Weigh your baby with your home scale, say ""open baby weight,"" and then for example, ""ten pounds four and a half ounces,"" (or kilograms and grams if you like) and that's it. After the second day recording weight, you'll start to hear back the change since last time. After a week of tracking, you'll be able to say ""report"" and get the recent daily average change. A well-rested adult with one hand reliably free could probably do this pretty easily with a notepad :) But for those of us who don't fit that description during the first year of our children's lives, well, I hope this skill helps. Apologies but this first version can only track one child's weight at a time. One last thing, if you just want to record one quick weight, it's not necessary to open and log in separate steps. You can just say, ""Alexa, tell baby weight fifteen pounds nine ounces.""

A great tool for freelancers, consultants, or anything that requires you to keep track of your time.

Just open work clock, create a project with any name, and from there you can clock in and out of the project. If you need to record your clocked times, just ask for an email with the report, and Alexa will send it to your email!

NOTE: You need to enable account linking in order to email yourself a summary of your project times.

Below is a list of common commands:

""Create new project""
""Hear existing projects""
""Clock into 'project name'""
""Clock out of 'project name'""
""Tell me the total time of 'project name'""
""Email me a summary of all projects""
""Delete 'project name'""
""Hear all commands""

You can also easily clock-in and clock-out in one utterance:
""Alexa open work clock and clock in/out of 'project name'""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Great skill","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KK7JHOMCFL2F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","If you follow the instructions exactly it works perfectly.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Does not work","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RJ2UE690ZZDTK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","I try to open applications on Alexa it till me my pin number which has a letter in it but no way to enter a letter only numbers.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

Examples:

Alexa, ask Counting Coach to count to twenty (will count in a regular 1 second pace from 1 to 20).

Alexa, tell Counting Coach to from one to eight fast (won't pause as much).

Alexa, ask Counting Coach to count to 3 very slowly (will make a longer pause between numbers and pronounce slowly and more clearly).

You can ask the skill to count between two numbers and to do it slow, very slowly, fast and very fast.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

For me personally, the level of risk that some remote person might be able to use it against me in some way is extremely low, or even if it were my next-door neighbor for that matter. However, after filling out the form it gave me someone else's network name and password. What's much worse is that that the name of the wifi network makes me believe that it's very likely someone near to my location, due to the name being a local reference. They may be using IP addresses as the way to determine the network identity, and I believe I may share a public-facing IP with other people in my neighborhood using the same cable internet provider, given that I haven't paid for a private IP address. That's just a guess at how it would even be possible for me to get the wrong person's wifi network and have it be someone using a local reference as their network name. The risk for me personally is still quite low, but I can see this being a very high risk to some people.

Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!

Bike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. 

First, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:
""Add an Address.""

Alexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".

Next, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".

Finally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".

Once saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""
Alexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo. 

If you need to change your address, just tell Bike Share: ""change my address"". Alexa will ask if you want to overwrite your current address; if you respond ""yes"", you will be given the chance to enter a new address.","null","bike share","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://www.kenpeltzer.com/bikeshare/bike-share-privacy-policy.html","null","","5","by Ken Peltzer","5","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01DOI0PKE","5.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","null","Idea for an update.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RE9JR7HZ8E2N6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01DOI0PKE","Was about to build a similar functionality myself.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Does what it does to the highest degree.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RINHGOFMCURE7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Would never have looked  behind my bed, fantastic.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""

Have a No-Contract Net10 Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your NET10 Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a NET10 Wireless Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check net10wireless.com/Alexa for more info.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Works great","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RQJCY37CJSW3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Alarms phone flawlessly even if it's silent","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 9, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3","",""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","","","","","","null","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8","",""

Baby Shush uses a thoroughly tested technique designed to break a baby's cry spell and engage their natural calming reflex.

The rhythmic shush reminds baby of being inside mom, where they were inundated 24 hours a day with loud sounds of blood flow and other in utero noises (up to 95 dBs, or the sound of a very loud vacuum cleaner). What may sound harsh at first is actually very calming to a baby.

It will play on loop so you don't have to worry about baby being suddenly woken up.

You can say:

""Alexa, open Baby Shush""
""Alexa, start Baby Shush""
""Alexa, launch Baby Shush""

It provides an another opportunity to practice listening skills.  
Details of development: I used the new beta AWS Developer Console function that develops your code inline which makes creating a new skill a no brainer and very fast. Could have done it in a couple hours had I known the syntax of subscript and how to create acceptable mp3 files for S3. As it was it took about a day to get everything done.
Found out that the mp3 file format must be 16000 and 48k or it won't work. 
Finally, it would be nice to get the user's local time and there is an API for that but unfortunately the API returns a text version of the users timezone (Like Africa) so you would need a database to look up the time offset from UTC. Too much work so this little skill just returns UTC. I know that I live in a timezone that is 8 hours ahead of UTC.
Anyway, it was a good exercise and it is nice to know it is so easy to make a skill now compared to earlier versions of AWS Skill Kit.","null","ham clock","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by JimBoy Production","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NRZ5P2B","5.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","UTC Morse Code","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R465JYSBZKXWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07NRZ5P2B","terrific program. 20 year NAVY RADIOMAN.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2019","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=4&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969810&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_3"

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Silent phone?

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Problems or questions?  Because there is no way for us to reply to reviews, please let us help by contacting us directly at info@audibleclock.com with any issues or thoughts on how we can improve the skill.  We'd also love to hear about what new clocks you'd like us to add.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

Turns out, it was actually pretty good (just like the pizza I ate). I was afraid it would be a cheesy app that tells me facts about pizza, but instead, it was different. This skill tries to compare two pizzas to see which is the better deal. I like that it was interactive and you don't have to enter everything in one mouthful. After entering the company name, it then prompts you for the size, and finally the price, and so on.  It then tells you which pizza is cheaper per square inch. So you could compare a large and a medium by the same pizza seller, and see if you should get the large for a little more, or the medium for a little less. In my case, the large did save me a few cents per square inch.  It would be 5 stars if it could tell me how much I will save by ordering the pizza it recommends. For example it could say ""the large is 2 cents per square inch cheaper. Your large pizza is xxx square inches, so you will save $1.96 by buying the large"". Overall, a highly recommended app for all the pizza eaters out there. It might save you some dough. Would be interested to hear what others think. (By the way, anchovies is small fish pickled in oil, in case you are new to pizza. Does anyone actually like fish on their pizza?)","4.0 out of 5 stars","July 4, 2017","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=14&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969830&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_13"

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:
“Ask Mosaic to change the color to blue”
“Ask Mosaic to lock up Tesla”
“Ask Mosaic for calendar summary”
“Ask Mosaic to warm up the house”
“Ask Mosaic for Good Morning”
""Ask Mosaic to turn on living room""

You can also renumber the list (which may be helpful after deleting items). HELP and STOP are also available at any time.

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:

To get started, simply say:

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:
“Ask Mosaic to change the color to blue”
“Ask Mosaic to lock up Tesla”
“Ask Mosaic for calendar summary”
“Ask Mosaic to warm up the house”
“Ask Mosaic for Good Morning”

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

(See below)
**Now supports multiple bin types. Currently supports recycling,
black, general, green, brown, blue, pink,
white,grey,red,yellow,orange, glass and garden**

**Request a new bin type by sending email to alexaozcalendar@gmail.com**


Let Bin Reminder  know what frequency your bins go out and also do they start this week or next.

To get started, you simply need to say 'Open Bin Reminder,' and you will be guided through the flow.
Once the initial setup is configured, it will be stored for future reference.

If you move house or your bin frequency changes, no problem! You can reset and start again by saying ""Alexa, ask Bin Reminder to reset"".

The skill supports ISO week of the year. That means, weeks start with Monday.

You can email me directly at alexaozcalendar@gmail.com

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:

This skill was originally developed for English-US before Alexa was available in Canada and it had problems for people that were using English-Canada as their language.  It now works for everyone. Huzah!

You can use the City of Ottawa Garbage Pickup Schedule to find out the date of your next pickup. Sometimes holidays will change the date of the pickup, or perhaps you just don't remember if you have to take out garbage or recycling this week. Now you can just ask Alexa to find out when you need to take out the garbage.

Please make sure to prefix your question with ""Alexa ask Ottawa Garbage"". You can also say ""Alexa, open Ottawa Garbage"" and the app will ask you if you want to know the next pick up date.  You can't just say ""Alexa, when is garbage day"". I wish all skills worked like that but they don't. For many skills including this one, you need to address them by name.

If you're address isn't recognized, hit me up on twitter @stevemulligan or email steve@nonlocal.ca and I will do my best to get the skill working properly for you.","Guidance Suggested.","ottawa garbage","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://ottawagarbage.nonlocal.ca/privacy.html","null","","4","by Non Local","4","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B073WSH4KH","3.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","Love love love","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRSBE7OMSAOPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B073WSH4KH","My husband asks me every week what day the garbage is.

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:
“Ask Mosaic to change the color to blue”
“Ask Mosaic to lock up Tesla”
“Ask Mosaic for calendar summary”
“Ask Mosaic to warm up the house”
“Ask Mosaic for Good Morning”
""Ask Mosaic to turn on living room""
""Ask Mosaic to play ambient sound""
""Ask Mosaic to read news""

It's never ONCE offered to unload the dishwasher, for example. However, it does make my life simpler. I can control a set of devices with one command (request) so I don't have to micromanage my environment. I really don't have the patience to tell Alexa to turn this light on red at this percentage, and that light to white at this percentage (and so on) and also tell me the weather and my appointments for the day. It's annoying. I like my routines. I like to have everything just so and I like not having to worry that I forgot to set the house up for being away. I can just send Mosaic a message on Facebook and tell it ""Goodbye"". I can even see what the last request I made was by looking at my Facebook messages.

That said, the selection of workflows is still limited this early in the game but the developers are really responsive to input on what workflows would be cool to add. The upside is that you make the workflows what you want them to be. We needed to have a workflow to light up our back hallway and so on to full white brightness. The best workflow to choose was ""House Party"" because we are introverted hermits who would NEVER have a party. It's actually kind of amusing when we need to use it. (especially since Alexa usually tells us to make sure we have enough ice)

Having established workflows to call on makes it easier to avoid naming conventions that confuse Alexa's voice recognition.

All things considered, it's a really useful skill and we use the daylights out of it (unlike the Dog Facts skill).

Every morning, without fail, I ask Alexa to tell Mosaic ""Good Morning"". On comes my desk lamp, out goes the night light in the hall, living room lamp is set to a dim blue, laundry room light turns off (it's on at 50% at night for late snackers in the kitchen) and Alexa tells me my schedule and the daily forecast and current temperature. It's pretty awesome.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 23, 2016","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=5&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969812&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_4"

This skill was originally developed for English-US before Alexa was available in Canada and it had problems for people that were using English-Canada as their language.  It now works for everyone. Huzah!

You can use the City of Ottawa Garbage Pickup Schedule to find out the date of your next pickup. Sometimes holidays will change the date of the pickup, or perhaps you just don't remember if you have to take out garbage or recycling this week. Now you can just ask Alexa to find out when you need to take out the garbage.

Please make sure to prefix your question with ""Alexa ask Ottawa Garbage"". You can also say ""Alexa, open Ottawa Garbage"" and the app will ask you if you want to know the next pick up date.  You can't just say ""Alexa, when is garbage day"". I wish all skills worked like that but they don't. For many skills including this one, you need to address them by name.

If you're address isn't recognized, hit me up on twitter @stevemulligan or email steve@nonlocal.ca and I will do my best to get the skill working properly for you.","Guidance Suggested.","ottawa garbage","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://ottawagarbage.nonlocal.ca/privacy.html","null","","4","by Non Local","4","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B073WSH4KH","3.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","Does not work on Canadian devices","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RLCRNJXD1IYR2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B073WSH4KH","Looks like a skill that should work on my device in Ottawa, but it is on amazon.com and not Amazon.ca, hence I can’t get it.

I hope you find Safe Place useful, thanks for checking it out!","null","safe place","dynamic content.","null","","null","","47","by petestanley.co.uk","47","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01N24AYGE","3.9 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","Need to change location","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XXI930CVZ1ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N24AYGE","I don't know how to make a change or make a correction.","3.0 out of 5 stars","January 25, 2017","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=17&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969836&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_16"

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","So far so good","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34RXVEJ8MXQUZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","So far thus works and no annoying ad.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:
“Ask Mosaic to change the color to blue”
“Ask Mosaic to lock up Tesla”
“Ask Mosaic for calendar summary”
“Ask Mosaic to warm up the house”
“Ask Mosaic for Good Morning”
""Ask Mosaic to turn on living room""
""Ask Mosaic to play ambient sound""
""Ask Mosaic to read news""

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","It works but...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3UWNK3WAC4O1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","I opened the stopwatch and then couldn't stop it!

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

Once connected, your Alexa Shopping & To-do lists will be added as new lists to your Any.do account (at the moment, these are the only lists available on Alexa).
Then just say ‘Alexa, add birthday plans to my To-Do list’ or ‘Alexa, add tomatoes to my Shopping list’.

These subtasks consisted of notes, URLs, and crucial details, many accumulated over time and impossible to replace. After a week or following up with support, I finally recovered 43 subtasks.

And if you want to backup your data, there's no an export function. It's 2019, ever heard of JSON or CSV?

And the ""priority support"" feature for Premium members is a complete farce. They don't even tell you HOW to contact support - it took me 20 minutes just to find an email address, and that's only because I contacted them on Facebook Messenger first out of sheer desperation.

Also, the UX of their Android and Chrome apps has been consistently frustrating. My settings were constantly being ""forgotten"" by the app. Constant sync and login issues. Occasional outages. Incredibly slow to implement even basic improvements (such as the ability to order subtasks). And the newest layout makes it even less intuitive in my opinion.

I switched to a task manager with automatic daily backups and the ability to download CSVs of my data, among a host of other features I didn't realize I was missing in Any.do.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

I think your software is probably as good as the next guys, but you're dropping the ball for sake of not listing a few lines of specific commands.
I got it to start and do a few things, but I couldn't stop it. But delete program stopped it.
Most every program has it's little quirks in dealing with Alexa, and yours is no different.

Check the ""My Stopwatch"" program descriptor page.
It's intuitive. A few ""proper"" sentences makes it clear.
EACH command spelled out. You can check each and you know it works.
You could have the best software on the block, but after a few rejected commands by Alexa you will lose peoples interest. The choice for me was clear, he won and you lost for a lack of directions.

But in all fairness I've found many Alexa programs that are sorely lacking in simple instructions spelling out the syntax that Alexa likes.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

This is a perfect skill to leave on while you are asleep, to use for relaxation and meditation, or to tune in and focus on your work.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","NO iPhone Support!!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RBVYS67AR2EDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Please work with Apple to include iPhone Support.","1.0 out of 5 stars","May 1, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6","",""

Have a No-Contract Net10 Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your NET10 Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a NET10 Wireless Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check net10wireless.com/Alexa for more info.

This skill may not be suitable for all ages. The skill requires a Net10 phone and service.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""

Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Simple Mobile to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Simple Mobile, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Simple Mobile to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Simple Mobile to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a Simple Mobile Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check simplemobile.com/Alexa for more info.

Baby Shush uses a thoroughly tested technique designed to break a baby's cry spell and engage their natural calming reflex.

The rhythmic shush reminds baby of being inside mom, where they were inundated 24 hours a day with loud sounds of blood flow and other in utero noises (up to 95 dBs, or the sound of a very loud vacuum cleaner). What may sound harsh at first is actually very calming to a baby.

It will play on loop so you don't have to worry about baby being suddenly woken up.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Galaxy s6 doesn't ring on silent","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YUFLT68966E7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","It calls my phone, but doesn't override volume settings to make it ring on vibrate.","2.0 out of 5 stars","December 26, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2","",""

Have a No-Contract Net10 Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your NET10 Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a NET10 Wireless Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check net10wireless.com/Alexa for more info.

This skill may not be suitable for all ages. The skill requires a Net10 phone and service.

(See below)
**Now supports multiple bin types. Currently supports recycling,
black, general, green, brown, blue, pink,
white,grey,red,yellow,orange, glass and garden**

**Request a new bin type by sending email to alexaozcalendar@gmail.com**


Let Bin Reminder  know what frequency your bins go out and also do they start this week or next.

To get started, you simply need to say 'Open Bin Reminder,' and you will be guided through the flow.
Once the initial setup is configured, it will be stored for future reference.

If you move house or your bin frequency changes, no problem! You can reset and start again by saying ""Alexa, ask Bin Reminder to reset"".

The skill supports ISO week of the year. That means, weeks start with Monday.

You can email me directly at alexaozcalendar@gmail.com

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","works well","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PVZY7VAV8E82/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","perfect to find my phine","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2019","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5","",""

You can use the City of Ottawa Garbage Pickup Schedule to find out the date of your next pickup. Sometimes holidays will change the date of the pickup, or perhaps you just don't remember if you have to take out garbage or recycling this week. Now you can just ask Alexa to find out when you need to take out the garbage.

Please make sure to prefix your question with ""Alexa ask Ottawa Garbage"". You can also say ""Alexa, open Ottawa Garbage"" and the app will ask you if you want to know the next pick up date.  You can't just say ""Alexa, when is garbage day"". I wish all skills worked like that but they don't. For many skills including this one, you need to address them by name.

Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!

Bike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. 

First, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:
""Add an Address.""

Alexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".

Next, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".

Finally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".

Once saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""
Alexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Also a distant feature might be adding a way to check specific neighborhoods in a city.

NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Problems or questions?  Because there is no way for us to reply to reviews, please let us help by contacting us directly at info@audibleclock.com with any issues or thoughts on how we can improve the skill.  We'd also love to hear about what new clocks you'd like us to add.

Care should be taken to carefully control the ascent rate and follow a decompression stop protocol for all dives, even those within recreational no-stop limits, to minimize the stresses on our bodies.","null","dive planner","dynamic content.","Developer Terms of Use","http://diveplanner.psicoder.org/#termsofuse","null","","5","by psicoder.org","5","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01N9WJ4GY","2.6 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calculators","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=6&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969814&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_5"

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Misleading function","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SISFBRE8P392/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Maybe because I have an iPhone.

Set in Saigon in 1965, during the Vietnam War, the film stars Robin Williams as a radio DJ on Armed Forces Radio Service, who proves hugely popular with the troops, but infuriates his superiors with what they call his ""irreverent tendency"". 

The story is loosely based on the experiences of AFRS radio DJ Adrian Cronauer.

And now alexa can start your day with this awesome, iconic line. 

You can say:

""Alexa, open Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, start Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, launch Good Morning Vietnam""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","You have to set the skill up first...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5O32R9X6OUGJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","I can*not* believe people actually expect this skill to work when they haven't yet paired with or identified the device you want it to search for... really?

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Care should be taken to carefully control the ascent rate and follow a decompression stop protocol for all dives, even those within recreational no-stop limits, to minimize the stresses on our bodies.","null","dive planner","dynamic content.","Developer Terms of Use","http://diveplanner.psicoder.org/#termsofuse","null","","5","by psicoder.org","5","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01N9WJ4GY","2.6 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calculators","Fail","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11BONMWBV2YXK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01N9WJ4GY","Me ""Alexa ask dive planner to plan a dive at 45 feet for 30 minutes""

Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!

There are two modes: 
Mode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.

Mode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.
Mode two format is as follows: 
tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.

To use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:

To Begin:
Alexa, ask time tone to play.   This defaults to the first mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for first.   Plays the first mode.

Alexa, ask time tone for second.   Plays the second mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for rain.   Plays the second mode.


To end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):
Alexa, ask time tone to end.     
Alexa, ask time tone finish.

Disclaimer: Timer accuracy is dependent on a variety of factors, including network latency and reliability. Not meant for mission-critical/time sensitive tasks.","null","time tone","dynamic content.","null","","null","","6","by OneToTheIO","6","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01MS3BBAT","3.6 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Soothing Clock","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SFWRNLMHVLRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MS3BBAT","Fulfils description.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!

There are two modes: 
Mode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.

Mode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.
Mode two format is as follows: 
tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.

To use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:

To Begin:
Alexa, ask time tone to play.   This defaults to the first mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for first.   Plays the first mode.

Alexa, ask time tone for second.   Plays the second mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for rain.   Plays the second mode.


To end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):
Alexa, ask time tone to end.     
Alexa, ask time tone finish.

Not meant for mission-critical/time sensitive tasks.","null","time tone","dynamic content.","null","","null","","6","by OneToTheIO","6","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01MS3BBAT","3.6 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Very useful for trai","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3J6QTQF12NS6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01MS3BBAT","Very useful for training and fit","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 26, 2018","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=5&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969812&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_4"

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a Tracfone Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check tracfone.com/Alexa for more info.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Start your list by saying ADD TO LIST followed by the text you wish to add.  Use READ LIST to hear the list. A number is assigned to each item in the list.  To remove an item from the list say DELETE NUMBER n, where n is the number of the item you wish to remove.   You can clear the list by saying CLEAR LIST. You can also renumber the list (which may be helpful after deleting items). HELP and STOP are also available at any time.

REMEMBER THIS was originally written for the visually impaired, who cannot use the standard Alexa To Do skill, because it requires seeing the list to delete items.  The ability to verbally delete items easily was the primary driver for this skill.","null","remember this","dynamic content.","null","","null","","105","by RURx77","105","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B072WCVV9X","3.3 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","Jared to use","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4FDFN51AJN80/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B072WCVV9X","I have to say a new item too fast, no time for hesitation.

Weigh your baby with your home scale, say ""open baby weight,"" and then for example, ""ten pounds four and a half ounces,"" (or kilograms and grams if you like) and that's it. After the second day recording weight, you'll start to hear back the change since last time. After a week of tracking, you'll be able to say ""report"" and get the recent daily average change. A well-rested adult with one hand reliably free could probably do this pretty easily with a notepad :) But for those of us who don't fit that description during the first year of our children's lives, well, I hope this skill helps. Apologies but this first version can only track one child's weight at a time. One last thing, if you just want to record one quick weight, it's not necessary to open and log in separate steps.

Set in Saigon in 1965, during the Vietnam War, the film stars Robin Williams as a radio DJ on Armed Forces Radio Service, who proves hugely popular with the troops, but infuriates his superiors with what they call his ""irreverent tendency"". 

The story is loosely based on the experiences of AFRS radio DJ Adrian Cronauer.

And now alexa can start your day with this awesome, iconic line. 

You can say:

""Alexa, open Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, start Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, launch Good Morning Vietnam""

NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

(See below)
**Now supports multiple bin types. Currently supports recycling,
black, general, green, brown, blue, pink,
white,grey,red,yellow,orange, glass and garden**

**Request a new bin type by sending email to alexaozcalendar@gmail.com**


Let Bin Reminder  know what frequency your bins go out and also do they start this week or next.

To get started, you simply need to say 'Open Bin Reminder,' and you will be guided through the flow.
Once the initial setup is configured, it will be stored for future reference.

If you move house or your bin frequency changes, no problem! You can reset and start again by saying ""Alexa, ask Bin Reminder to reset"".

The skill supports ISO week of the year. That means, weeks start with Monday.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Problems or questions?  Because there is no way for us to reply to reviews, please let us help by contacting us directly at info@audibleclock.com with any issues or thoughts on how we can improve the skill.  We'd also love to hear about what new clocks you'd like us to add.

 

If you are enjoying this skill, share your enthusiasm by leaving a 5-star review.  Positive reviews help support the creation of new clocks and features.

(See below)
**Now supports multiple bin types. Currently supports recycling,
black, general, green, brown, blue, pink,
white,grey,red,yellow,orange, glass and garden**

**Request a new bin type by sending email to alexaozcalendar@gmail.com**


Let Bin Reminder  know what frequency your bins go out and also do they start this week or next.

To get started, you simply need to say 'Open Bin Reminder,' and you will be guided through the flow.
Once the initial setup is configured, it will be stored for future reference.

If you move house or your bin frequency changes, no problem! You can reset and start again by saying ""Alexa, ask Bin Reminder to reset"".

The skill supports ISO week of the year. That means, weeks start with Monday.

You can email me directly at alexaozcalendar@gmail.com
 with any questions, comments or concerns.

Have a No-Contract Tracfone Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your Tracfone Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a Tracfone Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check tracfone.com/Alexa for more info.

A great tool for freelancers, consultants, or anything that requires you to keep track of your time.

Just open work clock, create a project with any name, and from there you can clock in and out of the project. If you need to record your clocked times, just ask for an email with the report, and Alexa will send it to your email!

NOTE: You need to enable account linking in order to email yourself a summary of your project times.

Below is a list of common commands:

""Create new project""
""Hear existing projects""
""Clock into 'project name'""
""Clock out of 'project name'""
""Tell me the total time of 'project name'""
""Email me a summary of all projects""
""Delete 'project name'""
""Hear all commands""

You can also easily clock-in and clock-out in one utterance:
""Alexa open work clock and clock in/out of 'project name'""

For instance, I started a project called “House Cleaning”.  The next time I clocked in, she didnt clock me in there, she made a brand new project called ‘house Queening”.  I tried for 40 minuts to clock out of that one, but couldnt figure out what was wrong. Then, next, she made yet a third project, called “Ahouse Cleaning”. same problem.  “Maddox Cleans”. Became “Maddox Queens”  “Mattix Spleens”, and now the latest disaster we can not even get it to clock out of.  I now have 12 projects, and i only needed 4, I can not get her to understand and delete them.

I wish there was a way to maybe initially TYPE the project name, and also a way to say “Clock out of everything”, so when it gets like that, there is a foolproof way to just clock out when she will not cooperate. Also wish there was a way to say “Add 30 minutes to House Cleaning”, for when i forgot to clock in.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 16, 2019","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=12&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969826&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_11"

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Can't clear stop watch","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R274066RG6WZ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","Stop watch keeps running

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Don't waste your time","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3MFY5PTO1TAD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","It only,  ONLY does Start.

Ask ""What time is it"" and L. Cars will tell you the current decimal time. (Stardates and decimal time are approximate and based on UTC-05:00, ""Eastern Time,"" they are also fictional and should not be used for actual time keeping). In both the television shows and movies set in the Star Trek Universe, the fictional ""stardate"" system of time keeping set the shows in a far off future. This skill will let you know the current stardate according to a proprietary calculation method unique to this skill. For more information on the system used to devise the current stardate, please visit https://jhelman857.wixsite.com/home/stardate . For more information on decimal time please visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time .

You can say:

""Alexa, open L. Cars""
""Alexa, start L. Cars""
""Alexa, launch L. Cars""
""Alexa, ask L. Cars what the time is""
""Alexa, ask L. Cars what the date is""

""What is the Stardate""
""What is the Decimal Time?""
""Exit Program""

Upon invoking the skill it will run automatically and give you the current stardate. You can end the program by saying ""Stop,"" or it will end automatically after approximately two minutes.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

Baby Shush uses a thoroughly tested technique designed to break a baby's cry spell and engage their natural calming reflex.

The rhythmic shush reminds baby of being inside mom, where they were inundated 24 hours a day with loud sounds of blood flow and other in utero noises (up to 95 dBs, or the sound of a very loud vacuum cleaner). What may sound harsh at first is actually very calming to a baby.

It will play on loop so you don't have to worry about baby being suddenly woken up.

You can say:

""Alexa, open Baby Shush""
""Alexa, start Baby Shush""
""Alexa, launch Baby Shush""

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Simple Mobile to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Simple Mobile to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a Simple Mobile Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check simplemobile.com/Alexa for more info.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

Arti is conducted by the singing of a special prayer and the playing of musical instruments. The piece was composed by Muktanand Swami on 5 November 1802.[1][2] During the aarti, a lighted ghee lamp with wicks is waved before murtis, representations of Swaminarayan and other deities.[3] Swaminarayan is believed to be physically manifest in the murti, and several arti ceremonies are performed throughout the day, allowing devotees to show their devotion. As the murti is not permanently on view for devotees, the arti is an important opportunity to gain blessings through darshan of a physical manifestation of Swaminarayan. In shikharbaddha mandirs, aarti is performed five times a day according to Vaishnava tradition, while In dev mandirs or Hari mandirs, arti is performed in the morning and evening only.[4] The BAPS version of the aarti is based on an original manuscript of Muktanand Swami’s works.[5]

More info from Wikipedia:
A lunar calendar is a calendar based upon the monthly cycles of the Moon's phases (synodic months), in contrast to solar calendars, whose annual cycles are based only directly upon the solar year. 
...
Although the Gregorian calendar is in common and legal use in most countries, traditional lunar and lunisolar calendars continue to be used throughout the Old World to determine religious festivals and national holidays. Examples of such holidays include Ramadan (Islamic calendar); Easter, the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian New Year (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian calendars); the Nepali New Year (Nepali calendar); the Mid-Autumn Festival and Chuseok (Chinese and Korean calendars); Loi Krathong (Thai calendar); Sunuwar calendar; Diwali (Hindu calendars); and Rosh Hashanah (Hebrew calendar).","null","lunar calendar","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by Next Big Idea","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07JKZD6HB","5.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=11&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969824&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_10"

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","love it.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UMBJWA1TCMGN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","life saver","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 21, 2019","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2","",""

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

More info from Wikipedia:
A lunar calendar is a calendar based upon the monthly cycles of the Moon's phases (synodic months), in contrast to solar calendars, whose annual cycles are based only directly upon the solar year. 
...
Although the Gregorian calendar is in common and legal use in most countries, traditional lunar and lunisolar calendars continue to be used throughout the Old World to determine religious festivals and national holidays. Examples of such holidays include Ramadan (Islamic calendar); Easter, the Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian New Year (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Mongolian calendars); the Nepali New Year (Nepali calendar); the Mid-Autumn Festival and Chuseok (Chinese and Korean calendars); Loi Krathong (Thai calendar); Sunuwar calendar; Diwali (Hindu calendars); and Rosh Hashanah (Hebrew calendar).","null","lunar calendar","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by Next Big Idea","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07JKZD6HB","5.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","great app","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYNE1U1ST417N/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07JKZD6HB","awesome app","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 28, 2019","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=11&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969824&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_10"

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:

Have a No-Contract Net10 Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your NET10 Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a NET10 Wireless Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check net10wireless.com/Alexa for more info.

Huzah!

You can use the City of Ottawa Garbage Pickup Schedule to find out the date of your next pickup. Sometimes holidays will change the date of the pickup, or perhaps you just don't remember if you have to take out garbage or recycling this week. Now you can just ask Alexa to find out when you need to take out the garbage.

Please make sure to prefix your question with ""Alexa ask Ottawa Garbage"". You can also say ""Alexa, open Ottawa Garbage"" and the app will ask you if you want to know the next pick up date.  You can't just say ""Alexa, when is garbage day"". I wish all skills worked like that but they don't. For many skills including this one, you need to address them by name.

If you're address isn't recognized, hit me up on twitter @stevemulligan or email steve@nonlocal.ca and I will do my best to get the skill working properly for you.","Guidance Suggested.","ottawa garbage","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://ottawagarbage.nonlocal.ca/privacy.html","null","","4","by Non Local","4","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B073WSH4KH","3.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","One Star","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22GUHTNIE2GTZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B073WSH4KH","Would be good if it worked in Canada since the Echo has arrived.","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 10, 2018","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=14&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969830&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_13"

And, of course, you can open the skill by saying:

""Alexa, open Translation Please.""
""Alexa, start Translation Please.""
and
""Alexa, begin Translation Please.""

Once you start, it's as simple as saying:
""translate, what day is it today""
or
""translate, it's about time you got here""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","No app to find the Kindle Fire...It seems senseless to not publish an app.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R39JJYXM8UFZXR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","No app to find the Kindle Fire...It seems senseless as the Kindle Fire and Alexa are BOTH Amazon products Think about it...","1.0 out of 5 stars","March 30, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4","",""

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Totally useless.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SNUEXQXZPGQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","It only starts.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Brain dead app","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R237KWELR7ZJBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","This app is totally braindead.

Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!

There are two modes: 
Mode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.

Mode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.
Mode two format is as follows: 
tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.

To use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:

To Begin:
Alexa, ask time tone to play.   This defaults to the first mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for first.   Plays the first mode.

Alexa, ask time tone for second.   Plays the second mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for rain.   Plays the second mode.


To end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):
Alexa, ask time tone to end.     
Alexa, ask time tone finish.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Doesn't work","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32ZWLHSGD5L3B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","I read the prior review about issues and decided to try anyway due to the lack of other options.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Works perfectly","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2NGD4R6NNVUAF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","I think a lot of people are commanding her to ""find my phone"".

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

(See below)
**Now supports multiple bin types. Currently supports recycling,
black, general, green, brown, blue, pink,
white,grey,red,yellow,orange, glass and garden**

**Request a new bin type by sending email to alexaozcalendar@gmail.com**


Let Bin Reminder  know what frequency your bins go out and also do they start this week or next.

To get started, you simply need to say 'Open Bin Reminder,' and you will be guided through the flow.
Once the initial setup is configured, it will be stored for future reference.

If you move house or your bin frequency changes, no problem! You can reset and start again by saying ""Alexa, ask Bin Reminder to reset"".

The skill supports ISO week of the year. That means, weeks start with Monday.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Go Back To the Drawing Board","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VAK7J5354NFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","All of the stopwatch skills have one FAULT which prevents them from being useful.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

I am also going to try to design one via Blueprint. It would be nice to be reminded to bring my handkerchief, lip balm, pills, a sweater, etc while I am still packing.

1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","This app works very well","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RRHIAAL0NJ77Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Works everytime for me.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!

There are two modes: 
Mode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.

Mode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.
Mode two format is as follows: 
tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.

To use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:

To Begin:
Alexa, ask time tone to play.   This defaults to the first mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for first.   Plays the first mode.

Alexa, ask time tone for second.   Plays the second mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for rain.   Plays the second mode.


To end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):
Alexa, ask time tone to end.     
Alexa, ask time tone finish.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Memory Bank comes to the rescue in these, and many other situations. Call on Memory Bank to remember whatever it was you were doing. Then, after handling the situation that interrupted you, ask Memory Bank to recall the memory. 

Memory Bank is meant to be fast and simple because you may only have a few seconds preserve the memory before devoting your entire attention to the interruption. As such, it can only remember one thing at a time for you. Asking Memory Bank to remember a second memory will overwrite the first, but you can record a memory with a single sentence.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","","","","","","null","https://www.amazon.com/iCodeCompany-Stopwatch/product-reviews/B074XF7F68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=2&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969805&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_1"

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Commands are confusing","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RILQWSX1S2KYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","Why not just use start/pause/resume/stop/elapsed time?

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","works perfectly","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGSYZJVJRC06L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","it works as described. pair with phone and remember to say phone finder not find my phone, as that will default to the alexa app and that is worthless.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 29, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3","",""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!

There are two modes: 
Mode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.

Mode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.
Mode two format is as follows: 
tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.

To use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:

To Begin:
Alexa, ask time tone to play.   This defaults to the first mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for first.   Plays the first mode.

Alexa, ask time tone for second.   Plays the second mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for rain.   Plays the second mode.


To end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):
Alexa, ask time tone to end.     
Alexa, ask time tone finish.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Wont let you just say ""Find Phone"" which would be the most obvious thing when you are in a hurry","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RR8KQMARH75U0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Good app but having to remember to say Open Phone Finder is ridiculous.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!

Bike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. 

First, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:
""Add an Address.""

Alexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".

Next, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".

Finally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".

Once saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","NEEDS WORK - Can start it but checking elapsed time or finish time just deletes the timer","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3R21YMEIM9WLV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","This stopwatch in incompressible.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Say Alexa Stopwatch to start it.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

Have a No-Contract Tracfone Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your Tracfone Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a Tracfone Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check tracfone.com/Alexa for more info.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:
“Ask Mosaic to change the color to blue”
“Ask Mosaic to lock up Tesla”
“Ask Mosaic for calendar summary”
“Ask Mosaic to warm up the house”
“Ask Mosaic for Good Morning”
""Ask Mosaic to turn on living room""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","perfect","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R9ZZV4X10BQ9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","very useful","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 30, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5","",""

After my last game, Alexa said, “Since you like Jeopardy, would you like to play Powerball?” This implies that Powerball is a game that is similar to Jeopardy. I enabled it, then it asked if I wanted a quick pic or something else. I said quick pic, and it gave me a series of numbers. Then silence. Is that it? Are these numbers supposed to be winning numbers? What’s the point of this game? In what way is it anything at all like Jeopardy? Why would Alexa suggest that since I like Jeopardy I might like Powerball? Especially for a game that bears no resemblance at all to Jeopardy? And now I wonder: By enabling this skill, did I somehow enable Amazon to charge my credit card to buy Powerball tickets? This is the last thing I would want to do!! There are other reviews that pose the very same question, but no information at all in the app about what the game is intended to do: what is its purpose? How does one play it? In what way does it resemble Jeopardy? This now seems like some kind of scam, and I am worried that my card may be charged without my intent. I wanted to play a question-and-answer game, and now I find myself writing a lengthy message to Amazon! OK, so I had a little bit of time to kill. That doesn’t mean that I wanted to engage in an extended conversation with customer service!

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

Cars will boot up, tell you the current stardate in the style of Star Trek: TNG, and automatically close if there is no response from the user. A new feature added is decimal time. Ask ""What time is it"" and L. Cars will tell you the current decimal time. (Stardates and decimal time are approximate and based on UTC-05:00, ""Eastern Time,"" they are also fictional and should not be used for actual time keeping). In both the television shows and movies set in the Star Trek Universe, the fictional ""stardate"" system of time keeping set the shows in a far off future. This skill will let you know the current stardate according to a proprietary calculation method unique to this skill. For more information on the system used to devise the current stardate, please visit https://jhelman857.wixsite.com/home/stardate . For more information on decimal time please visit https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_time .

You can say:

""Alexa, open L. Cars""
""Alexa, start L. Cars""
""Alexa, launch L. Cars""
""Alexa, ask L. Cars what the time is""
""Alexa, ask L. Cars what the date is""

""What is the Stardate""
""What is the Decimal Time?""
""Exit Program""

Upon invoking the skill it will run automatically and give you the current stardate. You can end the program by saying ""Stop,"" or it will end automatically after approximately two minutes.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Doesn't work","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31BGFC0OY0MC1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","Doesn't work","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/iCodeCompany-Stopwatch/product-reviews/B074XF7F68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=2&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969805&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_1"

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","No IOS Support","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM3N4LE7930OG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","How can they skip the most sought after smartphone OS?","1.0 out of 5 stars","August 18, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7","",""

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Problems or questions?  Because there is no way for us to reply to reviews, please let us help by contacting us directly at info@audibleclock.com with any issues or thoughts on how we can improve the skill.  We'd also love to hear about what new clocks you'd like us to add.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Works perfectly (but Android only)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RW4100PHMMEAB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","I don't have an iPhone, so don't care about that lack of support.

This worked perfectly for me several times.  I even rebooted my phone just to see if it would work smoothly and it did.  If your phone is on vibrate or on silent, it will still make an alarm noise.

Default noise is very loud and annoying, but that's also perfect for this app and helps out be heard under from between the sofa cushions.

Only thing I don't like is the command:  ""Open phone finder and find my phone"".  Would really like that shortened or customizable to ""find my phone"".  Maybe someday they will improve the Routines to do this.","5.0 out of 5 stars","August 15, 2018","","","",""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Five Stars","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUW2VUDHRQ4QS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Thank's. Phone Finder","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 7, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_8?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=8","",""

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Great app. I’m always losing my phone in my ...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IJ0S9NVSCZFD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Great app.  I’m always losing my phone in my house so it’s great to be able to tell Alexa to call my phone.","5.0 out of 5 stars","February 10, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4","",""

A lot of other computer systems build off this very fundamental date and time, but since this was implemented so long ago, an update would be required for nearly every computer system on the planet to continue working.

Memory Bank comes to the rescue in these, and many other situations. Call on Memory Bank to remember whatever it was you were doing. Then, after handling the situation that interrupted you, ask Memory Bank to recall the memory. 

Memory Bank is meant to be fast and simple because you may only have a few seconds preserve the memory before devoting your entire attention to the interruption. As such, it can only remember one thing at a time for you. Asking Memory Bank to remember a second memory will overwrite the first, but you can record a memory with a single sentence.

For example: Alexa ask Memory Bank to remember that I need to mix in the chili powder, but I only want to use 1 tablespoon.","null","memory bank","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by Darvins Lab LLC","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B06XD93CYD","2.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Calendars & Reminders","","","","","","null","","",""

You can also renumber the list (which may be helpful after deleting items). HELP and STOP are also available at any time.

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Does Not Work","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XKBA2UFGNHXO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","Alexa, start stopwatch

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""

Have a No-Contract Tracfone Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your Tracfone Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a Tracfone Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check tracfone.com/Alexa for more info.

This skill may not be suitable for all ages. The skill requires a Tracfone phone and service.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.

1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""

4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""

4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

Arti is conducted by the singing of a special prayer and the playing of musical instruments. The piece was composed by Muktanand Swami on 5 November 1802.[1][2] During the aarti, a lighted ghee lamp with wicks is waved before murtis, representations of Swaminarayan and other deities.[3] Swaminarayan is believed to be physically manifest in the murti, and several arti ceremonies are performed throughout the day, allowing devotees to show their devotion. As the murti is not permanently on view for devotees, the arti is an important opportunity to gain blessings through darshan of a physical manifestation of Swaminarayan. In shikharbaddha mandirs, aarti is performed five times a day according to Vaishnava tradition, while In dev mandirs or Hari mandirs, arti is performed in the morning and evening only.[4] The BAPS version of the aarti is based on an original manuscript of Muktanand Swami’s works.[5]

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.

1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App

6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Details of development: I used the new beta AWS Developer Console function that develops your code inline which makes creating a new skill a no brainer and very fast. Could have done it in a couple hours had I known the syntax of subscript and how to create acceptable mp3 files for S3. As it was it took about a day to get everything done.
Found out that the mp3 file format must be 16000 and 48k or it won't work. 
Finally, it would be nice to get the user's local time and there is an API for that but unfortunately the API returns a text version of the users timezone (Like Africa) so you would need a database to look up the time offset from UTC. Too much work so this little skill just returns UTC. I know that I live in a timezone that is 8 hours ahead of UTC.
Anyway, it was a good exercise and it is nice to know it is so easy to make a skill now compared to earlier versions of AWS Skill Kit.","null","ham clock","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by JimBoy Production","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07NRZ5P2B","5.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=4&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969810&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_3"

Weigh your baby with your home scale, say ""open baby weight,"" and then for example, ""ten pounds four and a half ounces,"" (or kilograms and grams if you like) and that's it. After the second day recording weight, you'll start to hear back the change since last time. After a week of tracking, you'll be able to say ""report"" and get the recent daily average change. A well-rested adult with one hand reliably free could probably do this pretty easily with a notepad :) But for those of us who don't fit that description during the first year of our children's lives, well, I hope this skill helps. Apologies but this first version can only track one child's weight at a time. One last thing, if you just want to record one quick weight, it's not necessary to open and log in separate steps. You can just say, ""Alexa, tell baby weight fifteen pounds nine ounces.""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

This skill does what is says it will do. I like to do workouts on my elliptical and exercise bike where I increase the level of resistance every five minutes. I used to set an Echo timer every five minutes and then have to cancel it when it went off before setting the next five minutes. This works so much better. Set it once and it does the rest.
The Bad:
None that I can think of.

UPDATE:
I thought this skill worked but it doesn’t. It just stops after several intervals, without finishing the request. And any other request to the Echo processing this skill causes it to cancel. I love the IDEA of this skill and would love to use it. A shame the thing doesn’t actually work.
Observations:
I like the idea the one reviewer suggested who suggested a countdown option. I would like to also control the interval of the notice, like tell me every minute during the countdown. But, this wish does not impact my review of what the skill does do.

I HATE people who give a product a bad review because it does not do what THEY want it to do. If you don’t like what it does, then don’t use it. Write your own skill. Amazon give you that ability.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 27, 2018","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=2&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969805&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_1"

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""

Set in Saigon in 1965, during the Vietnam War, the film stars Robin Williams as a radio DJ on Armed Forces Radio Service, who proves hugely popular with the troops, but infuriates his superiors with what they call his ""irreverent tendency"". 

The story is loosely based on the experiences of AFRS radio DJ Adrian Cronauer.

And now alexa can start your day with this awesome, iconic line. 

You can say:

""Alexa, open Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, start Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, launch Good Morning Vietnam""

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!

Bike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. 

First, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:
""Add an Address.""

Alexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".

Next, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".

Finally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".

Once saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""
Alexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo. 

If you need to change your address, just tell Bike Share: ""change my address"". Alexa will ask if you want to overwrite your current address; if you respond ""yes"", you will be given the chance to enter a new address.","null","bike share","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://www.kenpeltzer.com/bikeshare/bike-share-privacy-policy.html","null","","5","by Ken Peltzer","5","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01DOI0PKE","5.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","null","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=7&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969816&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_6"

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","One Star","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2CJW9MGIV9ZAC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","Does not show stopwatch","1.0 out of 5 stars","February 19, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/iCodeCompany-Stopwatch/product-reviews/B074XF7F68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=2&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969805&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_1"

This skill was originally developed for English-US before Alexa was available in Canada and it had problems for people that were using English-Canada as their language.  It now works for everyone. Huzah!

You can use the City of Ottawa Garbage Pickup Schedule to find out the date of your next pickup. Sometimes holidays will change the date of the pickup, or perhaps you just don't remember if you have to take out garbage or recycling this week. Now you can just ask Alexa to find out when you need to take out the garbage.

Please make sure to prefix your question with ""Alexa ask Ottawa Garbage"". You can also say ""Alexa, open Ottawa Garbage"" and the app will ask you if you want to know the next pick up date.  You can't just say ""Alexa, when is garbage day"". I wish all skills worked like that but they don't. For many skills including this one, you need to address them by name.

All you have to do is say “Alexa, ask Ottawa garbage when is the next pickup date”. Just like the instructions say... and the developer is really friendly and will update the skill if you add other wordings for using it.

If you had a problem using it, it’s most likely because you didn’t invoke it properly, like you said “Alexa when is the next pickup date” and you left out the crucial “Ottawa garbage” part. That’s a limitation amazon imposes on skills, not the developers fault. You can also say “Alexa open Ottawa garbage” if that’s easier for you.","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 30, 2017","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=14&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969830&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_13"

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

(See below)
**Now supports multiple bin types. Currently supports recycling,
black, general, green, brown, blue, pink,
white,grey,red,yellow,orange, glass and garden**

**Request a new bin type by sending email to alexaozcalendar@gmail.com**


Let Bin Reminder  know what frequency your bins go out and also do they start this week or next.

To get started, you simply need to say 'Open Bin Reminder,' and you will be guided through the flow.
Once the initial setup is configured, it will be stored for future reference.

If you move house or your bin frequency changes, no problem! You can reset and start again by saying ""Alexa, ask Bin Reminder to reset"".

The skill supports ISO week of the year. That means, weeks start with Monday.

Mosaic supports Google Calendar, Fitbit, Nest, Philips Hue, Lifx, Jawbone, Withings, Automatic, Tesla, Rachio, Insteon, Weather, Commute, News and Ambient Sound, with many more to come.

Workflow Example:
Our ""Good Morning"" workflow can help you warm up the house, give you today's weather forecast, report your Tesla battery level and mile range, followed by a brief summary of your Google calendar events and commute time to work. 

Immediately enjoy predefined Mosaic workflows or customize your own with the devices and services you love. Whether it’s Good Morning, Chill out, or I am home - easily control your life with one simple command.

All these functionalities are also available by typing to Mosaic’s Chatbot on Facebook Messengers, Slack, and SMS. When talking is not convenient, typing also gets things done!

To get started,
First, enable the Mosaic Skill.
Second, create a Mosaic account at https://saymosaic.com 
Finally, just link your favorite devices and services and start enjoying our pre-defined Mosaic workflows or create your own.

A few popular commands from existing Mosaic users:
“Ask Mosaic to change the color to blue”

“Ask Mosaic for calendar summary”
“Ask Mosaic to warm up the house”
“Ask Mosaic for Good Morning”

A common problem known in computer engineering is the Year 2038 problem.

To build up the list of kit for each day, use ""Alexa, ask School Kit to add kit for Tuesday"". You'll be prompted for the item of kit you want to add and who it is for. 
Alternatively, use ""Alexa, open School Kit. Add Games Kit for Thomas for Tuesday"". 
You can add as many items you like for as many children as you have. 

Once your kit lists are in place, use ""Alexa, ask School Kit what kit I need for Tomorrow"" or ""Alexa, ask School Kit what kit Sarah needs on Wednesday"" and Alexa will tell you what you need.

To remove items of kit, use ""Alexa, ask School Kit to remove kit for Wednesday"" to clear all items from Wednesday or ""Alexa, open School Kit. Remove Games Kit from Thomas on Tuesday"" to remove a single item.

If you have a two week timetable, you can set up two week's worth of kit. School Kit will keep track of which week is current and tell you what kit you need. If the weeks get out of sync due to holidays, you can switch which of the two weeks is current.

First, ask Alexa to switch to a two week timetable by saying ""Alexa, open School Kit. Set the timetable to two weeks."". 

School kit can only set up one week of kit at a time so add kit as described above for the first week then switch to the second. To switch between weeks say  ""Alexa, ask School Kit to switch weeks"". You can then add the kit you need for the second week and when you are done, switch back to the first week by again saying ""Alexa, ask School Kit to switch weeks"".

When you're done, ask what kit you need as normal and if the date falls in the second week School Kit will tell you the kit from week two. 

If you change your mind, you can always say ""Alexa, ask School Kit to set the timetable to one week"" to go back to a one week timetable.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","can't stop it","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RM2IA22B28W3G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","After beginning the stopwatch, i used ""ask stopwatch"" to get the status. i did NOT receive any extra prompts.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","No iPhone support?","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RTZKTF4RTYTRI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","At all?","1.0 out of 5 stars","April 20, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_7?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=7","",""

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

Only complaint it I wish he was a smidge louder. I know he's whispering :P but with the Dot at my regular using volume, couldn't really understand the quote though the time was clear enough.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Problems or questions?  Because there is no way for us to reply to reviews, please let us help by contacting us directly at info@audibleclock.com with any issues or thoughts on how we can improve the skill.  We'd also love to hear about what new clocks you'd like us to add.

 

If you are enjoying this skill, share your enthusiasm by leaving a 5-star review.  Positive reviews help support the creation of new clocks and features.

They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating. Thanks!","null","whisper guy","dynamic content.","null","","null","","140","by Christopher Ottley","140","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0746SGH65","3.4 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","i like it","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SZQBK5O5TQRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0746SGH65","It is a nice add on i followed the directionsand it was really good","5.0 out of 5 stars","January 5, 2019","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Christopher-Ottley-Whisper-Guy/product-reviews/B0746SGH65/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=13&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969828&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_12"

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","I found out how to work the stopwatch skill. ...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BVZM41QL8HUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","I found out how to work the stopwatch skill.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","With a little trial and error I figured out how ...","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGFTKSU7LFVOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","With a little trial and error I figured out how to use the Stopwatch skill with my Echo Dot.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Good skill to have","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R300YTK50A245Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Like most skills if you don't  repeat exactly word for word what Alexa asks for ,she won't  work","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 4, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5","",""

Once account is mapped, customers could ask: “Alexa, ask Just Energy”, the skill will come back with a ""welcome"" response and identify the mapped customer. Say: ""What are my bill details"", the skill will respond with the current bill details. Say: ""Tell me an energy fact"", the skill will respond back with a random energy fact or energy savings tip. Say: “Contact Just Energy”, the skill will respond back with Just Energy’s contact information. Say: ""Help"", the skill will respond by listing all questions a customer can ask Just Energy.  Say: ""Quit"" or ""Exit"", the skill will quit.","Guidance Suggested.","just energy","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://www.justenergy.com/about-us/privacy-policy/","Developer Terms of Use","https://www.justenergy.com/about-us/terms-of-use/","11","by Just Energy","11","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01EGDRMWU","3.2 out of 5 stars","Utilities","null","works fine.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33W38HIWVLPR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01EGDRMWU","works the way it said it wood.","4.0 out of 5 stars","January 22, 2019","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=19&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969840&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_18"

Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!

Bike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. 

First, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:
""Add an Address.""

Alexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".

Next, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".

Finally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".

Once saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""
Alexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo.

Have a No-Contract Net10 Wireless Smartphone? Then this skill will make it easy for you to get the most out of your smartphone. First, you will need to Enable the skill and enter your NET10 Phone number. Now you are ready to take advantage of this skill.
 
Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Net TEN to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a NET10 Wireless Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check net10wireless.com/Alexa for more info.

This skill may not be suitable for all ages. The skill requires a Net10 phone and service.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Works like a charm","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R33FFY978LO5PH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Love this feature","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 12, 2018","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4","",""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:

To build up the list of kit for each day, use ""Alexa, ask School Kit to add kit for Tuesday"". You'll be prompted for the item of kit you want to add and who it is for. 
Alternatively, use ""Alexa, open School Kit. Add Games Kit for Thomas for Tuesday"". 
You can add as many items you like for as many children as you have. 

Once your kit lists are in place, use ""Alexa, ask School Kit what kit I need for Tomorrow"" or ""Alexa, ask School Kit what kit Sarah needs on Wednesday"" and Alexa will tell you what you need.

To remove items of kit, use ""Alexa, ask School Kit to remove kit for Wednesday"" to clear all items from Wednesday or ""Alexa, open School Kit. Remove Games Kit from Thomas on Tuesday"" to remove a single item.

If you have a two week timetable, you can set up two week's worth of kit. School Kit will keep track of which week is current and tell you what kit you need. If the weeks get out of sync due to holidays, you can switch which of the two weeks is current.

First, ask Alexa to switch to a two week timetable by saying ""Alexa, open School Kit. Set the timetable to two weeks."". 

School kit can only set up one week of kit at a time so add kit as described above for the first week then switch to the second. To switch between weeks say  ""Alexa, ask School Kit to switch weeks"". You can then add the kit you need for the second week and when you are done, switch back to the first week by again saying ""Alexa, ask School Kit to switch weeks"".

When you're done, ask what kit you need as normal and if the date falls in the second week School Kit will tell you the kit from week two. 

If you change your mind, you can always say ""Alexa, ask School Kit to set the timetable to one week"" to go back to a one week timetable.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","My Stopwatch Won't Stop!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24QT44SO3O8T3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","It has been 3 days since I started the stopwatch on my Echo for and have no idea how to stop it.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Saves me a lot of time","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FW9T674IQC53/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","My phone is always on my desk or night stand... usually.

Thus, a stopwatch differs from Alexa’s default timer which rings after a definable period of time (for example, five minutes) or Alexa’s default alarm which rings at a certain time (for example, 8 o'clock).

This stopwatch is characterized by a very simple operation, with which you do not have to remember any commands, since they are announced if necessary. You use the start word, “Alexa, start stopwatch” or “Alexa, open stopwatch” or “Alexa, ask stopwatch” for all functions (start, status, reset, delete). The stopwatch is started without asking the first time or after a deletion. On the next calls the elapsed time is announced in hours, minutes, seconds. The stopwatch then suggests one the following three commands:

- “Restart”: Reset the old time first so the stopwatch starts at zero,
- “Delete”: Deletes the stopwatch so it starts automatically at zero when skill is called again,
- “Continue” or no command: Stopwatch continues.

If there are more than 24 hours between the start and the next query, the stopwatch will be reset automatically the next time you start. This does not require any of the three commands.","null","stop watch","dynamic content.","null","","null","","37","by iCodeCompany","37","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B074XF7F68","2.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Alarms & Clocks","Terrible Skill","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I0YUW41G61VL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B074XF7F68","I thought it would be a nice tool to have on my Echo Spot.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

Apologies for the recent disruption, my hosting shut down on me while I was in the hospital. However, I've now moved to paid hosting, and added Pause/Restart!

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Problems or questions?  Because there is no way for us to reply to reviews, please let us help by contacting us directly at info@audibleclock.com with any issues or thoughts on how we can improve the skill.  We'd also love to hear about what new clocks you'd like us to add.

Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!

There are two modes: 
Mode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.

Mode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.
Mode two format is as follows: 
tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.

To use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:

To Begin:
Alexa, ask time tone to play.   This defaults to the first mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for first.   Plays the first mode.

Alexa, ask time tone for second.   Plays the second mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for rain.   Plays the second mode.


To end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):
Alexa, ask time tone to end.     
Alexa, ask time tone finish.

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

If you like it, please leave a nice rating.

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

By default he tells you UTC/GMT time, so you would have to let him know what timezone you are in using the offset command. You only need to do this once, but can change it at any time. This is necessary as Amazon does not share timezone information with skills.

Whisper Guy also comes with two additional optional features:
1) Silent Open and
2) Horror Quote.

Silent open changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that when you open whisper guy, there is no audio response and it waits for your input. By default this setting is off. It also removes the lead in phrase from the reply time (it is now, the time is etc.) making the response shorter. To turn 'Silent Open' on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to on'. To turn 'Silent Open' off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set silent open to off'.

Horror quote changes Whisper Guy's behaviour so that five seconds after Whisper Guy tells the time, he whispers a quote from a horror movie. There are three modes for horror quote. The default mode is off. When off, Whisper Guy does not include a quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When on, Whisper Guy always includes a random quote from a horror movie after he whispers the time. When random, Whisper Guy randomly includes a quote (50% of the time) from a horror movie after he whispers the time. To turn horror quote on, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote on'. To turn horror quote off, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote off'. To change horror quote to be random, say 'Alexa, ask Whisper Guy to set horror quote random'.

Below is a list of the horror quotes that Whisper Guy knows:
That cold ain't the weather. That's death approaching.
They're all gonna laugh at you.
Hi, I'm Chucky. Wanna play?
When there is no room left in hell, the dead will walk the earth.
What an excellent day for an exorcism.
Is that blood on your zombie?
It's Alive! It's Alive!
I should warn you, princess – the first time tends to get a little messy.
I've seen enough horror movies to know that any weirdo wearing a mask is never friendly.
The dead are not quiet in Hill House.
No tears please, it's a waste of good suffering.
You know that part in scary movies when somebody does something really stupid and everyone hates them for it? This is it.
I'm your number one fan.
Well, you just pissed me off.
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.
Sometimes dead is better.
No more dead bodies for Daddy tonight.
They're here!
We all go a little mad sometimes.
I wanna play a game.
It's been a funny sort of day, hasn't it?
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
I see dead people.
Trust is a tough thing to come by these days.
Meats meat, and a man's gotta eat.
They won't stay dead.
I warned you not to go out tonight.
Humans are such easy prey.
Be afraid. Be very afraid.

These two optional features would make it very easy to play a practical joke on someone by asking Whisper Guy the time and then either leaving the room before the horror quote is whispered or pretending not to hear the horror quote, so I take no responsibility for how you use your newfound power, but enjoy!

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Set in Saigon in 1965, during the Vietnam War, the film stars Robin Williams as a radio DJ on Armed Forces Radio Service, who proves hugely popular with the troops, but infuriates his superiors with what they call his ""irreverent tendency"". 

The story is loosely based on the experiences of AFRS radio DJ Adrian Cronauer.

And now alexa can start your day with this awesome, iconic line. 

You can say:

""Alexa, open Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, start Good Morning Vietnam""
""Alexa, launch Good Morning Vietnam""

It's a useful, fun, and entertaining way to track the time.



NEW!

Due to popular demand, you can now specify how frequently a clock chimes whenever you choose a clock that normally goes off every quarter hour.

See www.audibleclock.com/FAQ for details, or contact us at info@audibleclock.com with any feedback, questions, or suggestions.

 

 

IMPORTANT NOTE

This skill works like a long playlist or one of the many ""sleep sounds"" skills, so you can easily (even accidentally) stop it by asking Alexa to ""stop.""  In fact, if you ask Alexa to play a song or open a ""sleep sounds"" skill, Audible Clock will stop so Alexa can play the song or sleep sounds instead.  Audible Clock is easy to restart, of course: just say ""Alexa, open Audible Clock"" and tell it which clock you want to listen to.

 

 

FUN TIP

Many people dedicate one of their Alexa devices to use as a talking clock.  Simply launch Audible Clock on the chosen Echo and then press the microphone mute button so it won't be accidentally interrupted.

 

 

CLOCK SHOP

Want a clock that meows like a cat?  We've got that.  How about one that sounds like Big Ben, a cow, or even Stephen Hawking?  We've got those too.  We're always adding new clocks so you'll never get bored.

 

To try a new clock while one is already running, just say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a mantle clock"" (or another clock of your choice).

 

For a full list of available clocks, visit www.audibleclock.com or say ""Alexa, ask Audible Clock for a list of clocks.""  We're always adding new clocks, so check back frequently.

 

 

PREMIUM CLOCKS

In addition to its many free clocks, Audible Clock offers a few Premium Clocks you can purchase.  These quality clocks offer higher production values, clearer recordings, and/or an innovative twist on what a clock can be (ever hear a cat ""meow"" the Westminster Chimes?).  Once purchased, a Premium Clock can be used as many times as you like.

 

 

SUPPORT

Add Airtime: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to Add Airtime” Alexa will send a text message to your phone to start the process.  It’s that simple.

Refill Date: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone, What is my refill date?” Never miss a cycle date again. Alexa can help you stay connected.

Data Usage: Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to check my Data Usage.” Always know where you stand with Data, so you can enjoy your music, games and apps without worry.

Update APN settings:  Say “Alexa, Ask Tracfone to update my APN settings.”  If you are activating your own phone with a Tracfone Bring Your Own Phone Kit, Alexa can help you get the right APN settings. Really important, so you can get Data and MMS messages on your phone.

We will be building more features soon, so check tracfone.com/Alexa for more info.

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","Simple, works great","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MDCMY7DFW0RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","Simple works great with app on phone","5.0 out of 5 stars","December 24, 2017","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2","",""

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Instead of simply beeping at a predetermined time, this skill provides second and 10 second interval updates! Has two modes! One that great for motivating short, 5 minute tasks The other mode is great for providing white background noise with a gentle reminder of time!

There are two modes: 
Mode 1). A 5 minute long timer. Uses beeps to indicate individual seconds and speech for 10 second intervals. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.

Mode 2). An hour long soothing timer. Uses a soothing tick-tock water noise to indicate seconds and periodic thunder for every 10 second interval. Can end at any point, at which it returns the amount of time elapsed.
Mode two format is as follows: 
tick tock tick tock tick tock tick tock tick thunder.

To use, there are a variety of ways to activate each timer. The general schema is:

To Begin:
Alexa, ask time tone to play.   This defaults to the first mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for first.   Plays the first mode.

Alexa, ask time tone for second.   Plays the second mode.
Alexa, ask time tone for rain.   Plays the second mode.


To end (Ends timer and returns elapsed time):
Alexa, ask time tone to end.     
Alexa, ask time tone finish.

It is on silent? This skill saves you: your device will ring with full volume and vibrate. Supports all your android devices!

UPDATE: Phone Finder Premium is now available! You can get the premium experience: Add up to six devices, name them and search for them by name.

In the free version, you can add one device. Connect your phone or tablet and never worry about losing them again.
Simply install the additional helper app on your Android device. You can find it in the Google Play Store. It's real simple:
1. Search for ""Phone Finder for Alexa"" in the Play Store and install it
2. Start the Alexa Skill: ""Alexa, open Phone Finder""
3. Ask Alexa to add a new device
4. Alexa tells you your personal PIN-code. It is also displayed in the Alexa App
5. Open the Android App. Enter your PIN code and press ""Activate""
6. Your device status becomes ""Active""
7. Done

To add an additional device, just repeat these steps. Now, you can ask any of your Alexas (on the same user account) to find your device. If your device is online, it will quickly start to ring loudly and vibrate.

You can just start the skill without any specific command:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder"". Alexa will ask you whether you would like to add, remove or search for a device. Alternatively, you can start the skill with a more specific command.

DIRECT COMMANDS:

Search for device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and search for my phone""
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder to find my device""

Add a new device:
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and add a new device""

Remove an existing device:
""Alexa, start Phone Finder and remove my phone""


Ask for the PIN code:
""Alexa, ask Phone Finder for my code""
""Alexa, open Phone Finder and give me my PIN""","null","phone finder","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://data-dive.com/pf-privacypolicy.html","null","","1,540","by data-dive.com","1,540","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9","3.7 out of 5 stars","Utilities","Device Tracking","no more lost phone","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WLOXUHV8YZ97/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B077KHD3T9","works as advertised","5.0 out of 5 stars","June 12, 2019","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/data-dive-com-Phone-Finder/product-reviews/B077KHD3T9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3","",""

You just start a stopwatch, and then you can check the status of the watch, restart the watch, or stop it at any point. You can also pause and resume the watch, and it will track the running total duration.

In addition to the explicit commands (start, status, reset, stop, pause, resume), launching the app also acts as a shortcut for managing your watch. Launching the app with no watch will start a new watch, while launching it with a running watch will automatically return your status.

Past reviews have mentioned the verbosity; there is no way for me to improve this as Alexa skills must be invoked by name.

I really waffled about whether to give it 3 or 4 stars, and finally decided on 4 because I'll only have to remember 2 commands - launch and stop - and it will let me play music at the same time. That is what I need a stopwatch skill for.

- There is a lot of variation in the command format. For example, ""Alexa, launch stopwatch"" or ""Alexa, start stopwatch"" starts a new stopwatch if one isn't already running - otherwise it gives you the status of the one running. But ""Alexa, status stopwatch"" or ""Alexa, stopwatch status"" doesn't work. ""Alexa, stop stopwatch"" also produces the status but does NOT stop the stopwatch. You have to say ""Alexa, ask stopwatch to stop"" to actually end it. Is it really necessary to use such a roundabout format?

- For actually using it, pretty much count on having to say ""Alexa, ask stopwatch to"" (pause, resume, stop). The simpler ""Alexa, launch stopwatch"" will start it or give you the status.

- As others have said, this isn't a precision function. I just want to time how long I can pedal on the exercise bike, so a few seconds' variation won't make a difference to me. But if seconds matter to you, there isn't an Alexa skill that will meet your needs.

- More important to me, this runs in the background so I can have Alexa play music while I am on the exercise bike and still keep track of my time.","4.0 out of 5 stars","February 4, 2018","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=2&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969805&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_1"

Stay tuned for support for more bike share systems across the country!

Bike Share allows you to quickly find the closest bike share station to your address with bikes available! Use it on the way out of the house in the morning to avoid walking to an empty station. If a station has less than 3 bikes available, Bike Share will also let you know  the next station that is more populated. 

First, you need to add the address where your Amazon Echo resides. Start by saying:
""Add an Address.""

Alexa will prompt you, step by step, to add your address, starting with your house number. For example, if your address was 350 5th Avenue, 10118, when prompted for your house number, you would say ""three fifty"".

Next, Bike Share will ask for your street name. Using the above example address, you would say ""fifth avenue"".

Finally, Bike Share will ask for your zip code. In the above example, you would answer, ""one zero one one eight"".

Once saved, you can then ask at any time to find the closest bike. Just say: ""find me a bike.""
Alexa will remember your address indefinitely, so you'll never need to add an address again unless you move your Echo. 

If you need to change your address, just tell Bike Share: ""change my address"". Alexa will ask if you want to overwrite your current address; if you respond ""yes"", you will be given the chance to enter a new address.","null","bike share","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://www.kenpeltzer.com/bikeshare/bike-share-privacy-policy.html","null","","5","by Ken Peltzer","5","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01DOI0PKE","5.0 out of 5 stars","Utilities","null","I use it everyday","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R23GAGRZBWI1HD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01DOI0PKE","This skill keeps me from going to a station without bikes","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 4, 2017","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284882011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284882011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=7&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969816&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_6"
