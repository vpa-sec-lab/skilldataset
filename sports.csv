You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

Unfortunately I am not able to reply directly to your review.

The skill works using the invocation name ""o.w.l. standings"", so you need to say the whole thing (and spell out the 3 letters in O-W-L) to access the skill.

So written slightly different, you can try ""ask O-W-L standings when is the next game"" or simply ""open O-W-L standings"" would work as well.","5.0 out of 5 stars","May 26, 2019","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=10&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969720&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_9"

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

If you'd like live audio updates, just say yes!

'Yes'

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

**You will need to login from the Alexa companion app with a valid NBA League Pass subscription in order to listen to games.

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

Let Alexa give you the surf report for most California and Hawaii surf spots.  Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.

Using the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy.  

Here are examples to try: 
 
""Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday""
""When is the best day to surf Lowers""
""What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday""
""What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor""
""When is the best day to surf Pipeline""

For surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:
For example, just say ""Sunset Beach"" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, ""Sunset Beach on Thursday"" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday.        

Alexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name.   For example once you ask for a report like:
""What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier""

You can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:
""What is the tide report"" or just ""tide report?""
""When is the best day to surf""
""What is the water temperature"" or just ""water temperature""

If you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:
""Tide report for tomorrow"" or ""Tide report on Friday""

Listed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available.  There were too many to list here.  The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com.  New locations soon!!   If you want your surf spot added please mention it in comment below or at www.surfncircuits.com

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

The Running Clothes Advisor takes the guesswork out of getting dressed for your next outdoor run based on your local weather conditions. This simple guide may prompt you to enable location permissions in your Alexa app. If you do not wish to enable location permissions say, ""My Inputs"" for your personalized apparel recommendation.

Our exclusive apparel algorithm provides personalized apparel recommendations based on weather conditions and gender. This skill has been optimized with screen support for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices.

After your run, re-open the Running Clothes advisor and select ""log my run."" You can record your miles ran and how your run went. You can also tell Alexa if her recommendation was too hot or too cold and the algorithm will automatically adjust your recommendations going forward.

If you choose apparel advice based current weather conditions, Alexa will pull temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions based on your zip code. Alexa will prompt you for your gender and create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive apparel algorithm. Our exclusive algorithm is based on years of running experience and races including 5K, 10K, 10 Miler, Half Marathon, and Full Marathon distances. Caroline Dunn is a New York City Marathon 2018 Finisher.

If you select running outfit advice based on your inputs, Alexa will ask you for your gender, temperature, weather conditions (sunny, windy, cloudy, or raining), and your run intensity (easy run, or race), to create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive algorithm. Feel free to adjust based on your personal preference. This is only intended to be a guide.

This skill is fun to play during the long winter months when there is no baseball and you long to hear ""It's time for Dodgers baseball"".

Dodgers Fan Trivia is great for the entire family. Play with or against each other and see who really knows their Dodgers.

New trivia is constantly being added to the skill so keep coming back and playing.

One can listen to the score line of the live matches and recently finished matches. Upcoming matches which are just about to start can also be found. We bring you access to everything from the football action from the popular countries like England, Germany, Spain,Italy etc to your favourite league from your own country supporting about 100 different countries. We will also provide live scores for the upcoming football world cup 2018 ,other international events like confederations cup. This include playoffs, country friendlies, qualifiers etc. Also apart from increasing the number of countries supported we also provide support for alternate football tournaments like FA Cup, championship league, 2nd division football, World Cup U-20. In total you have access to around 100 different countries with total supported number of tournaments/leagues/play offs/friendlies/international etc.. more than 750!!!

To invoke the skill say football live.

After invoking the skill one can get the live score of a match in the league of a country by saying just the country name or saying football country name. By default, this will  search for live scores in the top divsion leagues  and if not found will search in the other leagues. For example if I say England, the skill will check for live matches happening now in the English Premier League and provide me with the live score if any match is going on.
If there is no match currently ongoing in that country, we show a sample list of few countries for which live scores are available now.

Many more new features are planned to also provide other information like league standings, upcoming fixtures, events like Red Cards, Goals Scored by Players etc.","null","football live","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by Rudram Bhattacharya","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D1SVBZJ","1.0 out of 5 stars","Games & Trivia","Games","Didnt work","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KCAI6GS58LRZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07D1SVBZJ","Could not get England scores, app kept saying England was invalid","1.0 out of 5 stars","September 2, 2018","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=17&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969735&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_16"

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

* Result and score for today's game if already played or in progress
* Time for today's game if not yet played (time reported always in US Eastern timezone)
* Result and score for yesterday's game if there was one

  1. Open the Alexa App or go to https://alexa.amazon.com
  2. In the Menu, go to Settings
  3. In Settings, go to Flash Briefing under the Accounts section
  4. This will show you all the Flash Briefing ""Feeds"" you have turned On and Off.  You should see ""Tampa Bay Rays Games"" listed under the On section, as that is the default (Go Rays!).  Now under the Off section you should see ""Unofficial MLB Game Info"" with a little down arrow.  Tap that (it may take a few seconds to list them all, this appears to be a bug in Alexa App).
  5. You should now see all the other 29 MLB teams listed.  Find your team and click/tap on it and this will enable the ""Feed"".
  6. Now that team should show under the On section and you can turn off the Rays Feed (or keep it on and embrace them as your favorite AL team!).

You can contact me directly at josh@userdel.com, or https://github.com/irlrobot/mlb_game_info, for feedback and bug reports.  Enjoy!

""Alexa, open Statmuse…""

“How did the Eagles do?”
""Who had the most passing yards in a season?""
After hearing Drew Brees answer, ask ""Where did you go to college?"" or ""How many touchdowns did you have last season?""

""Who won the World Series in 1945?""
""Which pitcher had the most strikeouts last year?""
After hearing the answer, ask ""What is his career ERA?""

""How did Steph Curry do last season?""
“Who do the Rockets play this week?”

“What hockey games are on tonight?”
“Tell me about the Golden Knights.”

Side note: This is obviously inspired by Monty Python's Holy Grail and i thought it would be cool to adapt this into an Alexa skill.","null","test of death","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by Mental_Pigeon","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07CV31R4T","1.0 out of 5 stars","Games & Trivia","Games","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=17&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969735&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_16"

The Running Clothes Advisor takes the guesswork out of getting dressed for your next outdoor run based on your local weather conditions. This simple guide may prompt you to enable location permissions in your Alexa app. If you do not wish to enable location permissions say, ""My Inputs"" for your personalized apparel recommendation.

Our exclusive apparel algorithm provides personalized apparel recommendations based on weather conditions and gender. This skill has been optimized with screen support for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices.

After your run, re-open the Running Clothes advisor and select ""log my run."" You can record your miles ran and how your run went. You can also tell Alexa if her recommendation was too hot or too cold and the algorithm will automatically adjust your recommendations going forward.

If you choose apparel advice based current weather conditions, Alexa will pull temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions based on your zip code. Alexa will prompt you for your gender and create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive apparel algorithm. Our exclusive algorithm is based on years of running experience and races including 5K, 10K, 10 Miler, Half Marathon, and Full Marathon distances. Caroline Dunn is a New York City Marathon 2018 Finisher.

If you select running outfit advice based on your inputs, Alexa will ask you for your gender, temperature, weather conditions (sunny, windy, cloudy, or raining), and your run intensity (easy run, or race), to create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive algorithm. Feel free to adjust based on your personal preference. This is only intended to be a guide.

Ask Alexa for a ""situation"" for any position and she will give you a setup (runners on base, # of outs) and tell you where and how the ball is hit.  She then takes a brief pause before explaining what should be done in the given situation.

An example would be:
 - ""You are playing shortstop""
 - ""There are runners on First and Third""
 - ""There is one out""
 - ""There is a hard-ground ball to Second Baseman""
 - ""What is your play?""
 - ""Your play is to hustle to Second Base to take the toss from Second Baseman for one out and then make quick throw to First Base to complete the double play!""

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This Skill has one feed for every MLB team so be sure to enable the feeds for the teams you are interested in.  Data for all feeds is currently refreshed every few minutes.

This Skill currently tells you the following during your Flash Briefing:
* Result and score for today's game if already played or in progress
* Time for today's game if not yet played (time reported always in US Eastern timezone)
* Result and score for yesterday's game if there was one

Please note, Flash Briefing Skills must have a ""Default"" feed.  The Tampa Bay Rays feed will be enabled by default (the author's favorite team), so please remember to disable it in your Flash Briefing settings if you do not want Rays information.  Here's how you can enable a different feed:
  1. Open the Alexa App or go to https://alexa.amazon.com
  2. In the Menu, go to Settings
  3. In Settings, go to Flash Briefing under the Accounts section
  4. This will show you all the Flash Briefing ""Feeds"" you have turned On and Off.  You should see ""Tampa Bay Rays Games"" listed under the On section, as that is the default (Go Rays!).  Now under the Off section you should see ""Unofficial MLB Game Info"" with a little down arrow.  Tap that (it may take a few seconds to list them all, this appears to be a bug in Alexa App).
  5. You should now see all the other 29 MLB teams listed.  Find your team and click/tap on it and this will enable the ""Feed"".
  6. Now that team should show under the On section and you can turn off the Rays Feed (or keep it on and embrace them as your favorite AL team!).

You can contact me directly at josh@userdel.com, or https://github.com/irlrobot/mlb_game_info, for feedback and bug reports.  Enjoy!

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You can customize the player names by saying ""Change Player One/Two name to <name>"".

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

The Running Clothes Advisor takes the guesswork out of getting dressed for your next outdoor run based on your local weather conditions. This simple guide may prompt you to enable location permissions in your Alexa app. If you do not wish to enable location permissions say, ""My Inputs"" for your personalized apparel recommendation.

Our exclusive apparel algorithm provides personalized apparel recommendations based on weather conditions and gender. This skill has been optimized with screen support for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices.

After your run, re-open the Running Clothes advisor and select ""log my run."" You can record your miles ran and how your run went. You can also tell Alexa if her recommendation was too hot or too cold and the algorithm will automatically adjust your recommendations going forward.

If you choose apparel advice based current weather conditions, Alexa will pull temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions based on your zip code. Alexa will prompt you for your gender and create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive apparel algorithm. Our exclusive algorithm is based on years of running experience and races including 5K, 10K, 10 Miler, Half Marathon, and Full Marathon distances. Caroline Dunn is a New York City Marathon 2018 Finisher.

If you select running outfit advice based on your inputs, Alexa will ask you for your gender, temperature, weather conditions (sunny, windy, cloudy, or raining), and your run intensity (easy run, or race), to create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive algorithm. Feel free to adjust based on your personal preference. This is only intended to be a guide.

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

This skill is fun to play during the long winter months when there is no baseball and you long to hear ""It's time for Dodgers baseball"".

Dodgers Fan Trivia is great for the entire family. Play with or against each other and see who really knows their Dodgers.

New trivia is constantly being added to the skill so keep coming back and playing.

I had music playing, which appropriately muted and Alexa said, “Let’s call those Hogs!,” which was actually very muddled, but I could overlook that part had the call been better. It was probably 5 notches quieter on the volume control than what I had been listening to, and I had to strain to hear it. I have my Echo Spot connected to a [very high quality] speaker (apparently we cannot use other brand names in reviews), so sufficed to say, it wasn’t the sub quality mono speaker at fault. It sounded like someone just had their tv on, recorded it on their phone from across the room, then posted it as an Alexa skill. I mean, if you’re going to post it, I’m sure UA would provide you an HD or UHD audio clip, or even better would be a video clip. That way you get to witness the spectacle of Razorback Nation as well as actually hearing it clearly. But that’s just a suggestion. At the very least, you could have a Razorback on my screen. I do like that I don’t need to stop my other skill to use it. I could be listening to the game, a commercial break comes along and I could just have an impromptu hog call-which sometimes happens!","2.0 out of 5 stars","August 21, 2018","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=9&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969718&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_8"

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You can say, what is the current ranking of a particular player, who is the current number one player, who are the current top 10 players.

HOW TO USE:

To Get Started: Say ""Alexa Open a. t. p. Rankings"". 

Say ""What is the current ranking of {player name}""
For example ""What is the current ranking of Rafael Nadal""

{player name} - Player Name (ex. Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic etc)

Say ""Who is the current number {ranking} player""
For example ""Who is the current number one player""

{ranking} - No (1 - 500)

Say ""Who are the current top {index} players in the world""
For example ""Who are the current top 10 players in the world""

{index} - No (1 - 25)

For any of the above interactions, you can also use the one-shot phrasing.

For example 
""Open a. t. p. Rankings and get me the current ranking of Rafael Nadal""
""Open a. t. p. Rankings and get me the current number three player""
""Open a. t. p. Rankings and get the top 5 players""","null","a. t. p. rankings","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by SUNIL SALUNKHE","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0755S6YFN","5.0 out of 5 stars","Sports","News","This is so awesome.

It gives a short bio on some of the best skateboarders at the Venice Skatepark. Ask Alexa to find skateboarders from Venice and it will give you a list of skaters to pick from. Once you have info on a particular skater, you can ask for more info and it will give more info and a photo of the skater. Alexa will also offer to give information on random skaters.
Not all the skaters are from Venice. But it’s a good starting point.
Venice Skater Guide lets you ask questions like “Find me skaters from Venice”, or “What is Haden’s instagram username?” , or “Tell me about Matt LeMond?”.","null","venice skater guide","dynamic content.","null","","null","","2","by Venice Skates","2","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B0764NPZ36","5.0 out of 5 stars","Sports","News","Great!!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BDZHZ0UTUTH4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0764NPZ36","This app is sick","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 7, 2017","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=20&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969741&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_19"

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

Say ""Alexa, ask StatMuse who has the most career receiving yards?"" and hear Jerry Rice tell you about his record. Then try ""Who had the most touchdowns last season?"" to hear from David Johnson. Ask ""When are the Falcons playing next?"" to have Devonta Freeman give you his game schedule.



StatMuse provides instant answers to your NBA, NFL, MLB & NHL questions and features the authentic voices of Peyton Manning, Le'Veon Bell, Drew Brees, Terrell Owens, Jerry Rice and other players, plus Scott Van Pelt and Joe Buck. StatMuse is the officially licensed AI of the NFL Players Association.

Start by asking:
""Alexa, open Statmuse…""

“How did the Eagles do?”
""Who had the most passing yards in a season?""
After hearing Drew Brees answer, ask ""Where did you go to college?"" or ""How many touchdowns did you have last season?""

""Who won the World Series in 1945?""
""Which pitcher had the most strikeouts last year?""
After hearing the answer, ask ""What is his career ERA?""

""How did Steph Curry do last season?""
“Who do the Rockets play this week?”

“What hockey games are on tonight?”
“Tell me about the Golden Knights.”

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

This Skill has one feed for every MLB team so be sure to enable the feeds for the teams you are interested in.  Data for all feeds is currently refreshed every few minutes.

This Skill currently tells you the following during your Flash Briefing:
* Result and score for today's game if already played or in progress
* Time for today's game if not yet played (time reported always in US Eastern timezone)
* Result and score for yesterday's game if there was one

Please note, Flash Briefing Skills must have a ""Default"" feed.  The Tampa Bay Rays feed will be enabled by default (the author's favorite team), so please remember to disable it in your Flash Briefing settings if you do not want Rays information.  Here's how you can enable a different feed:
  1. Open the Alexa App or go to https://alexa.amazon.com
  2. In the Menu, go to Settings
  3. In Settings, go to Flash Briefing under the Accounts section
  4. This will show you all the Flash Briefing ""Feeds"" you have turned On and Off.  You should see ""Tampa Bay Rays Games"" listed under the On section, as that is the default (Go Rays!).  Now under the Off section you should see ""Unofficial MLB Game Info"" with a little down arrow.  Tap that (it may take a few seconds to list them all, this appears to be a bug in Alexa App).
  5. You should now see all the other 29 MLB teams listed.  Find your team and click/tap on it and this will enable the ""Feed"".
  6. Now that team should show under the On section and you can turn off the Rays Feed (or keep it on and embrace them as your favorite AL team!).

You can contact me directly at josh@userdel.com, or https://github.com/irlrobot/mlb_game_info, for feedback and bug reports.  Enjoy!

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

The Running Clothes Advisor takes the guesswork out of getting dressed for your next outdoor run based on your local weather conditions. This simple guide may prompt you to enable location permissions in your Alexa app. If you do not wish to enable location permissions say, ""My Inputs"" for your personalized apparel recommendation.

Our exclusive apparel algorithm provides personalized apparel recommendations based on weather conditions and gender. This skill has been optimized with screen support for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices.

After your run, re-open the Running Clothes advisor and select ""log my run."" You can record your miles ran and how your run went. You can also tell Alexa if her recommendation was too hot or too cold and the algorithm will automatically adjust your recommendations going forward.

If you choose apparel advice based current weather conditions, Alexa will pull temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions based on your zip code. Alexa will prompt you for your gender and create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive apparel algorithm. Our exclusive algorithm is based on years of running experience and races including 5K, 10K, 10 Miler, Half Marathon, and Full Marathon distances. Caroline Dunn is a New York City Marathon 2018 Finisher.

If you select running outfit advice based on your inputs, Alexa will ask you for your gender, temperature, weather conditions (sunny, windy, cloudy, or raining), and your run intensity (easy run, or race), to create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive algorithm. Feel free to adjust based on your personal preference. This is only intended to be a guide.

Let Alexa give you the surf report for most California and Hawaii surf spots.  Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.

Using the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy.  

Here are examples to try: 
 
""Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday""
""When is the best day to surf Lowers""
""What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday""
""What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor""
""When is the best day to surf Pipeline""

For surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:
For example, just say ""Sunset Beach"" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, ""Sunset Beach on Thursday"" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday.        

Alexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name.   For example once you ask for a report like:
""What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier""

You can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:
""What is the tide report"" or just ""tide report?""
""When is the best day to surf""
""What is the water temperature"" or just ""water temperature""

If you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:
""Tide report for tomorrow"" or ""Tide report on Friday""

Listed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available.  There were too many to list here.  The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com.  New locations soon!!   If you want your surf spot added please mention it in comment below or at www.surfncircuits.com

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

One can listen to the score line of the live matches and recently finished matches. Upcoming matches which are just about to start can also be found. We bring you access to everything from the football action from the popular countries like England, Germany, Spain,Italy etc to your favourite league from your own country supporting about 100 different countries. We will also provide live scores for the upcoming football world cup 2018 ,other international events like confederations cup. This include playoffs, country friendlies, qualifiers etc. Also apart from increasing the number of countries supported we also provide support for alternate football tournaments like FA Cup, championship league, 2nd division football, World Cup U-20. In total you have access to around 100 different countries with total supported number of tournaments/leagues/play offs/friendlies/international etc.. more than 750!!!

To invoke the skill say football live.

After invoking the skill one can get the live score of a match in the league of a country by saying just the country name or saying football country name. By default, this will  search for live scores in the top divsion leagues  and if not found will search in the other leagues. For example if I say England, the skill will check for live matches happening now in the English Premier League and provide me with the live score if any match is going on.
If there is no match currently ongoing in that country, we show a sample list of few countries for which live scores are available now.

Many more new features are planned to also provide other information like league standings, upcoming fixtures, events like Red Cards, Goals Scored by Players etc.","null","football live","dynamic content.","null","","null","","1","by Rudram Bhattacharya","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07D1SVBZJ","1.0 out of 5 stars","Games & Trivia","Games","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=17&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969735&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_16"

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

By now you're probably dreading having to look up the average draft position (ADP) of the different guys you're evaluating. 

Don't sweat it. We've built the ultimate fantasy football prep machine.

Now, simply ask Alexa what the ADP is of a certain player is and she'll tell you. 

It's literally talking fantasy football.

Here's an example of what you need to ask to get the ADP you're looking for:
- What is the ADP of Tom Brady?
- What is the average draft position of Drew Brees?
- Alex Smith

Using one of those variants (with your player's name swapped out) will give you exactly what you're looking for!

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

1. Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh for a quote
2. Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh to play ""The Victors""
3. Alexa, ask Coach Harbaugh WHO'S GOT IT BETTER THAN US!?

Let Alexa give you the surf report for most California and Hawaii surf spots.  Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.

Using the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy.  

Here are examples to try: 
 
""Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday""
""When is the best day to surf Lowers""
""What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday""
""What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor""
""When is the best day to surf Pipeline""

For surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:
For example, just say ""Sunset Beach"" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, ""Sunset Beach on Thursday"" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday.        

Alexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name.   For example once you ask for a report like:
""What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier""

You can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:
""What is the tide report"" or just ""tide report?""
""When is the best day to surf""
""What is the water temperature"" or just ""water temperature""

If you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:
""Tide report for tomorrow"" or ""Tide report on Friday""

Listed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available.  There were too many to list here.  The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com.  New locations soon!!   If you want your surf spot added please mention it in comment below or at www.surfncircuits.com

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

Ask Alexa for a ""situation"" for any position and she will give you a setup (runners on base, # of outs) and tell you where and how the ball is hit.  She then takes a brief pause before explaining what should be done in the given situation.

An example would be:
 - ""You are playing shortstop""
 - ""There are runners on First and Third""
 - ""There is one out""
 - ""There is a hard-ground ball to Second Baseman""
 - ""What is your play?""
 - ""Your play is to hustle to Second Base to take the toss from Second Baseman for one out and then make quick throw to First Base to complete the double play!""

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

This Skill has one feed for every MLB team so be sure to enable the feeds for the teams you are interested in.  Data for all feeds is currently refreshed every few minutes.

This Skill currently tells you the following during your Flash Briefing:
* Result and score for today's game if already played or in progress
* Time for today's game if not yet played (time reported always in US Eastern timezone)
* Result and score for yesterday's game if there was one

Please note, Flash Briefing Skills must have a ""Default"" feed.  The Tampa Bay Rays feed will be enabled by default (the author's favorite team), so please remember to disable it in your Flash Briefing settings if you do not want Rays information.  Here's how you can enable a different feed:
  1. Open the Alexa App or go to https://alexa.amazon.com
  2. In the Menu, go to Settings
  3. In Settings, go to Flash Briefing under the Accounts section
  4. This will show you all the Flash Briefing ""Feeds"" you have turned On and Off.  You should see ""Tampa Bay Rays Games"" listed under the On section, as that is the default (Go Rays!).  Now under the Off section you should see ""Unofficial MLB Game Info"" with a little down arrow.  Tap that (it may take a few seconds to list them all, this appears to be a bug in Alexa App).
  5. You should now see all the other 29 MLB teams listed.  Find your team and click/tap on it and this will enable the ""Feed"".
  6. Now that team should show under the On section and you can turn off the Rays Feed (or keep it on and embrace them as your favorite AL team!).

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

It does a great job with this. But once you stray at all from this it goes off the rails.  It won't be able to answer individual questions, such as ""what was Babe Ruth's average in 1923?"".

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

And this skill does do that...after some work. You basically have to tell it everything--eg male/female, temperature, kind of run, etc. and then it gives you a canned recommendation, which isn't bad. The only thing that would be really cool is if it could remember your stats, and if it could incorporate a live weather feed so that you don't have to tell it that. For example, ""Alexa, ask running outfit advisor for a recommendation for Mark in Denver Colorado today at 2pm"".

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

By now you're probably dreading having to look up the average draft position (ADP) of the different guys you're evaluating. 

Don't sweat it. We've built the ultimate fantasy football prep machine.

Now, simply ask Alexa what the ADP is of a certain player is and she'll tell you. 

It's literally talking fantasy football.

Here's an example of what you need to ask to get the ADP you're looking for:
- What is the ADP of Tom Brady?
- What is the average draft position of Drew Brees?
- Alex Smith

Using one of those variants (with your player's name swapped out) will give you exactly what you're looking for!

Ask Alexa for a ""situation"" for any position and she will give you a setup (runners on base, # of outs) and tell you where and how the ball is hit.  She then takes a brief pause before explaining what should be done in the given situation.

An example would be:
 - ""You are playing shortstop""
 - ""There are runners on First and Third""
 - ""There is one out""
 - ""There is a hard-ground ball to Second Baseman""
 - ""What is your play?""
 - ""Your play is to hustle to Second Base to take the toss from Second Baseman for one out and then make quick throw to First Base to complete the double play!""

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

Once you've opened the skill, you can say things like:
-What is defensive pass interference?
-How many players are on a team?
-Who won Super Bowl 35?
-What's the difference between a running back and a wide receiver?
-Tell me about the Music City Miracle
-How tall is Aaron Rodgers?
-What does ‘move the chains’ mean?

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

This Skill has one feed for every MLB team so be sure to enable the feeds for the teams you are interested in.  Data for all feeds is currently refreshed every few minutes.

This Skill currently tells you the following during your Flash Briefing:
* Result and score for today's game if already played or in progress
* Time for today's game if not yet played (time reported always in US Eastern timezone)
* Result and score for yesterday's game if there was one

Please note, Flash Briefing Skills must have a ""Default"" feed.  The Tampa Bay Rays feed will be enabled by default (the author's favorite team), so please remember to disable it in your Flash Briefing settings if you do not want Rays information.  Here's how you can enable a different feed:
  1. Open the Alexa App or go to https://alexa.amazon.com
  2. In the Menu, go to Settings
  3. In Settings, go to Flash Briefing under the Accounts section
  4. This will show you all the Flash Briefing ""Feeds"" you have turned On and Off.  You should see ""Tampa Bay Rays Games"" listed under the On section, as that is the default (Go Rays!).  Now under the Off section you should see ""Unofficial MLB Game Info"" with a little down arrow.  Tap that (it may take a few seconds to list them all, this appears to be a bug in Alexa App).
  5. You should now see all the other 29 MLB teams listed.  Find your team and click/tap on it and this will enable the ""Feed"".
  6. Now that team should show under the On section and you can turn off the Rays Feed (or keep it on and embrace them as your favorite AL team!).

You can contact me directly at josh@userdel.com, or https://github.com/irlrobot/mlb_game_info, for feedback and bug reports.  Enjoy!

Let Alexa give you the surf report for most California and Hawaii surf spots.  Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.

Using the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy.  

Here are examples to try: 
 
""Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday""
""When is the best day to surf Lowers""
""What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday""
""What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor""
""When is the best day to surf Pipeline""

For surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:
For example, just say ""Sunset Beach"" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, ""Sunset Beach on Thursday"" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday.        

Alexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name.   For example once you ask for a report like:
""What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier""

You can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:
""What is the tide report"" or just ""tide report?""
""When is the best day to surf""
""What is the water temperature"" or just ""water temperature""

If you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:
""Tide report for tomorrow"" or ""Tide report on Friday""

Listed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available.  There were too many to list here.  The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com.  New locations soon!!   If you want your surf spot added please mention it in comment below or at www.surfncircuits.com

The Running Clothes Advisor takes the guesswork out of getting dressed for your next outdoor run based on your local weather conditions. This simple guide may prompt you to enable location permissions in your Alexa app. If you do not wish to enable location permissions say, ""My Inputs"" for your personalized apparel recommendation.

Our exclusive apparel algorithm provides personalized apparel recommendations based on weather conditions and gender. This skill has been optimized with screen support for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices.

After your run, re-open the Running Clothes advisor and select ""log my run."" You can record your miles ran and how your run went. You can also tell Alexa if her recommendation was too hot or too cold and the algorithm will automatically adjust your recommendations going forward.

If you choose apparel advice based current weather conditions, Alexa will pull temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions based on your zip code. Alexa will prompt you for your gender and create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive apparel algorithm. Our exclusive algorithm is based on years of running experience and races including 5K, 10K, 10 Miler, Half Marathon, and Full Marathon distances. Caroline Dunn is a New York City Marathon 2018 Finisher.

If you select running outfit advice based on your inputs, Alexa will ask you for your gender, temperature, weather conditions (sunny, windy, cloudy, or raining), and your run intensity (easy run, or race), to create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive algorithm. Feel free to adjust based on your personal preference. This is only intended to be a guide.

There's three main categories of these workouts: Girls, New Girls, and Hero WODs. The total number of these workouts is over one hundred.

Simply ask Alexa ""What is Grace?"", or ""What is Chelsea workout?""  Alexa will tell you what this WOD consists of.

Boxing Legends is great fun for the whole family as you block and move, duck and weave, would-be knock out punches and then counter-attack with jabs, hooks, crosses and uppercuts. 

Not only is it fun and easy to play, it is a great way to keep your mind sharp as it's a memory game for brain, memory and cognitive training. 

Commands include:
  - BLOCK: say, ""block left or right"" to defend a punch
   (e.g. to defend 'left jab, right cross', say, ""block left, block right"")
  - ATTACK: say, ""left or right, then jab, hook, cross or uppercut"" 
     (e.g. say, ""left jab, right cross, left uppercut"") 

Note: (1) it's important to say block or move first and then left or right, this makes Alexa pick up your commands better when defending.
(2) A shortcut to blocking is saying 'block left,right,left' etc. 

Other commands include:
- During the attack, you can say, ""repeat"" 
- To get your win/loss record, say, ""my stats""
- At anytime, you can stop by saying ""Alexa, stop""    

To start, just say ""Alexa, launch Boxing Legends"" or ""Alexa, open Boxing Legends"" .

Roxie is a skill that tracks all of the basic information around a one-on-one pickup game.  Here are different features.

To begin, say ""Start Game"" and a new game will be initialized.  By default, the games are three innings long, and each player gets ten swings.

You can customize the player names by saying ""Change Player One/Two name to <name>"".

Say pitch ball and Roxie will track that a pitch was thrown.  Let Roxie know what happened next - either say ""Strike, Ball, or Base Hit"" and it will track the score.","null","robot roxie","dynamic content.","null","","null","","3","by Drawrz.com","3","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01IOLXSW8","2.4 out of 5 stars","Sports","Exercise & Workout","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=28&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969757&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_27"

Boxing Legends is great fun for the whole family as you block and move, duck and weave, would-be knock out punches and then counter-attack with jabs, hooks, crosses and uppercuts. 

Not only is it fun and easy to play, it is a great way to keep your mind sharp as it's a memory game for brain, memory and cognitive training. 

Commands include:
  - BLOCK: say, ""block left or right"" to defend a punch
   (e.g. to defend 'left jab, right cross', say, ""block left, block right"")
  - ATTACK: say, ""left or right, then jab, hook, cross or uppercut"" 
     (e.g. say, ""left jab, right cross, left uppercut"") 

Note: (1) it's important to say block or move first and then left or right, this makes Alexa pick up your commands better when defending.
(2) A shortcut to blocking is saying 'block left,right,left' etc. 

Other commands include:
- During the attack, you can say, ""repeat"" 
- To get your win/loss record, say, ""my stats""
- At anytime, you can stop by saying ""Alexa, stop""    

To start, just say ""Alexa, launch Boxing Legends"" or ""Alexa, open Boxing Legends"" .

You have choices from a  variety of sports including hockey, baseball, basketball and football. 

The game offers clues through answer choices to help you guess the names of the cities or teams. If you are newbie to sports teams, do not despair - there is plenty of assistance built in.

To start the game simply say ""Alexa, launch teams quiz"". The game then will ask you to pick a sport of your choice - hockey, baseball, basketball or football. Once you make your choice, it then dives into the teams for that sport. You can ask for help, switch to a different sport or stop the game at any time.

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You have choices from a  variety of sports including hockey, baseball, basketball and football. 

The game offers clues through answer choices to help you guess the names of the cities or teams. If you are newbie to sports teams, do not despair - there is plenty of assistance built in.

To start the game simply say ""Alexa, launch teams quiz"". The game then will ask you to pick a sport of your choice - hockey, baseball, basketball or football.

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

Let Alexa give you the surf report for most California and Hawaii surf spots.  Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.

Using the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy.  

Here are examples to try: 
 
""Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday""
""When is the best day to surf Lowers""
""What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday""
""What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor""
""When is the best day to surf Pipeline""

For surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:
For example, just say ""Sunset Beach"" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, ""Sunset Beach on Thursday"" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday.        

Alexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name.   For example once you ask for a report like:
""What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier""

You can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:
""What is the tide report"" or just ""tide report?""
""When is the best day to surf""
""What is the water temperature"" or just ""water temperature""

If you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:
""Tide report for tomorrow"" or ""Tide report on Friday""

Listed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available.  There were too many to list here.  The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com.  New locations soon!!   If you want your surf spot added please mention it in comment below or at www.surfncircuits.com

Roxie is a skill that tracks all of the basic information around a one-on-one pickup game.  Here are different features.

To begin, say ""Start Game"" and a new game will be initialized.  By default, the games are three innings long, and each player gets ten swings.

You can customize the player names by saying ""Change Player One/Two name to <name>"".

Say pitch ball and Roxie will track that a pitch was thrown.  Let Roxie know what happened next - either say ""Strike, Ball, or Base Hit"" and it will track the score.","null","robot roxie","dynamic content.","null","","null","","3","by Drawrz.com","3","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B01IOLXSW8","2.4 out of 5 stars","Sports","Exercise & Workout","EPIC!","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BGSUTTO5FMPK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B01IOLXSW8","This is awesome!","5.0 out of 5 stars","November 20, 2016","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=28&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969757&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_27"

The Running Clothes Advisor takes the guesswork out of getting dressed for your next outdoor run based on your local weather conditions. This simple guide may prompt you to enable location permissions in your Alexa app. If you do not wish to enable location permissions say, ""My Inputs"" for your personalized apparel recommendation.

Our exclusive apparel algorithm provides personalized apparel recommendations based on weather conditions and gender. This skill has been optimized with screen support for Echo Show and Echo Spot devices.

After your run, re-open the Running Clothes advisor and select ""log my run."" You can record your miles ran and how your run went. You can also tell Alexa if her recommendation was too hot or too cold and the algorithm will automatically adjust your recommendations going forward.

If you choose apparel advice based current weather conditions, Alexa will pull temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions based on your zip code. Alexa will prompt you for your gender and create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive apparel algorithm. Our exclusive algorithm is based on years of running experience and races including 5K, 10K, 10 Miler, Half Marathon, and Full Marathon distances. Caroline Dunn is a New York City Marathon 2018 Finisher.

If you select running outfit advice based on your inputs, Alexa will ask you for your gender, temperature, weather conditions (sunny, windy, cloudy, or raining), and your run intensity (easy run, or race), to create a personalized recommendation based on our exclusive algorithm. Feel free to adjust based on your personal preference. This is only intended to be a guide.

StatMuse is the officially licensed AI of the NFL Players Association.

Start by asking:
""Alexa, open Statmuse…""

“How did the Eagles do?”
""Who had the most passing yards in a season?""
After hearing Drew Brees answer, ask ""Where did you go to college?"" or ""How many touchdowns did you have last season?""

""Who won the World Series in 1945?""
""Which pitcher had the most strikeouts last year?""
After hearing the answer, ask ""What is his career ERA?""

""How did Steph Curry do last season?""
“Who do the Rockets play this week?”

“What hockey games are on tonight?”
“Tell me about the Golden Knights.”

This uses ""Nerd Rank"" technology to crowd source ratings. They're good enough to be quotes as ""the Cliffs Notes of the Industry"" by The Washington Post in 2009.

Ease of Use: 3 out of 5. It's pretty simple, you can just ask for news, or about a certain player. It was better than I expected with the player names. It did crash once, but it got all the others I tried right. When it reads the general news, it is in several segments. It can get kind of long. It would have been nice if it was split up and you could cycle through them conversationally. Player news is also in segments, but the gap between them is less clear. This can create some confusion as one news update runs into the next. Also, the text comes straight from their site, and occasionally it reads web-links, which is confusing and unhelpful.

Usefulness: 3 out of 5. I know almost nothing about Fantasy Football. But this skill seems more of a Football news source rather than much to do about Fantasy Football. That's great for football fans. I don't know how great that is for Fantasy Football fans. Perhaps it should have been marketed more towards mainstream football enthusiasts.

Novelty: 3 out of 5. It's another ""read the news to  you"" skill. The news appears to be high quality and relevant for the topic. But it really is just about the news.

Overall: 3 out of 5. It's fairly specific in it's appeal, although, admittedly, football is rather popular. I'd like to see them add in more interaction and connect with the gameplay of Fantasy Football itself. There are several tools on the web site and I think the skill will improve greatly if they integrate those in going forward.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 4, 2015","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284869011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284869011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=6&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564969712&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_5"

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

Ask Alexa for a ""situation"" for any position and she will give you a setup (runners on base, # of outs) and tell you where and how the ball is hit.  She then takes a brief pause before explaining what should be done in the given situation.

An example would be:
 - ""You are playing shortstop""
 - ""There are runners on First and Third""
 - ""There is one out""
 - ""There is a hard-ground ball to Second Baseman""
 - ""What is your play?""
 - ""Your play is to hustle to Second Base to take the toss from Second Baseman for one out and then make quick throw to First Base to complete the double play!""

Once you've opened the skill, you can say things like:
-What is defensive pass interference?
-How many players are on a team?
-Who won Super Bowl 35?
-What's the difference between a running back and a wide receiver?
-Tell me about the Music City Miracle
-How tall is Aaron Rodgers?
-What does ‘move the chains’ mean?

This application makes finding out leaders in certain statistics as easy as just asking. As of right now this app can only return top ranking and you cannot make request by specific players or team statistics.

Users are able to request a multitude of different statistics that can be further specified by rank (1-10), top amount (top two, top three, top four, etc.) year (1871 - present), and league (All of Baseball, National League or American League). 

Here are some initial example requests:
-------------------------------------------
Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who is third in the National League in home runs.

Who leads the league in doubles?

Who lead the American League in wins in nineteen eighty six?

Who is the oldest player in the league?

Alexa, ask Baseball Reference, in nineteen ninety nine, who lead the league in home runs?

Who was top three in strikeouts?

Who was tenth in wins in the National League in nineteen seventy two
-------------------------------------------

Another feature available to users is that after a user makes a successful request and are prompted to ask another question, a user can build upon their previous request.


For Example:
-------------------------------------------
User Requests - ""Alexa, ask Baseball Reference who was second in the National League in hits in nineteen eighty three""

Alexa Responds - ""Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits in 1983.""

The user can now request a few things:

- Next -
User Requests - ""Who was next?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits in 1983.""

- Previous -
User Requests - ""Who was previous?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983 .""

- Rank -
User Requests - ""Who was sixth?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Dickie Thon was sixth in the National League with 177 Hits In 1983.""

- Top -
User Requests - ""Who was top three?""
Alexa Responds -  ""Jose Cruz and Andre Dawson were tied for first in the National League with 189 Hits In 1983. Rafael Ramirez was second in the National League with 185 Hits In 1983. Al Oliver was third in the National League with 184 Hits In 1983.""

Let Alexa give you the surf report for most California and Hawaii surf spots.  Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.

Using the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy.  

Here are examples to try: 
 
""Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday""
""When is the best day to surf Lowers""
""What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday""
""What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor""
""When is the best day to surf Pipeline""

For surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:
For example, just say ""Sunset Beach"" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, ""Sunset Beach on Thursday"" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday.        

Alexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name.   For example once you ask for a report like:
""What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier""

You can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:
""What is the tide report"" or just ""tide report?""
""When is the best day to surf""
""What is the water temperature"" or just ""water temperature""

If you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:
""Tide report for tomorrow"" or ""Tide report on Friday""

Listed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available.  There were too many to list here.  The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com.  New locations soon!!   If you want your surf spot added please mention it in comment below or at www.surfncircuits.com

Say ""Alexa, ask StatMuse who has the most career receiving yards?"" and hear Jerry Rice tell you about his record. Then try ""Who had the most touchdowns last season?"" to hear from David Johnson. Ask ""When are the Falcons playing next?"" to have Devonta Freeman give you his game schedule.



StatMuse provides instant answers to your NBA, NFL, MLB & NHL questions and features the authentic voices of Peyton Manning, Le'Veon Bell, Drew Brees, Terrell Owens, Jerry Rice and other players, plus Scott Van Pelt and Joe Buck. StatMuse is the officially licensed AI of the NFL Players Association.

Start by asking:
""Alexa, open Statmuse…""

“How did the Eagles do?”
""Who had the most passing yards in a season?""
After hearing Drew Brees answer, ask ""Where did you go to college?"" or ""How many touchdowns did you have last season?""

""Who won the World Series in 1945?""
""Which pitcher had the most strikeouts last year?""
After hearing the answer, ask ""What is his career ERA?""

""How did Steph Curry do last season?""
“Who do the Rockets play this week?”

“What hockey games are on tonight?”
“Tell me about the Golden Knights.”
StatMuse has comprehensive stats going back to 1947 for the NBA, 1920 for the NFL, 1876 for MLB and 1917 for the NHL.

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

You can interact with me in several ways:

(1) Open me by saying ""Alexa, open NBA."" You should always start your conversation with me this way.  This will trigger the welcome menu and tell you how to listen to live NBA action, check scores, and get schedule info. 

After you’ve opened the NBA skill…

(2) **To LISTEN TO A GAME**, tell me “Play the Cavs game"" or “Stream the Atlanta game.""  Most games have the home and away announcers, just say the team name for the announcers you want and we'll start streaming.  If Alexa has trouble recognizing your team name, be sure and use the city AND team name together, like “Houston Rockets.”

(3) To ask about the SCHEDULE, say “What games are on today?” OR “When do the Warriors play?”  Ask about a specific team to get broadcaster information for upcoming games.  

(4) Ask me about SCORES by saying, “What is the score of the Milwaukee Bucks game?” OR “What are the latest scores?""  

Additionally after opening the skill, you can say things to me like:

Who is playing now?
When do the Celtics play the Lakers?
What time are the Memphis Grizzlies on?
Did the Thunder win on Monday?

however, that second portion is where this scale falls flat. repeatedly I have attempted to narrow the search radius to 1 mile, or 6 miles, or 10 miles. I always get the same response. ""Sorry, the distance you specified is not valid."" this is true if I say one mile, 10 miles, three miles... you get the idea.

with the default search of 30 miles, this means if you're asking for an area that may be near a major city, you will get places that are 10, 15, 30 miles away from you.

if that could be adjusted, as in fixed, I would certainly bump up this review. however, as the skill stands as of today, I cannot give it any more than two stars.

The briefings are usually fast paced and high energy, so the volume just adds to the chaos.

This is a &quot;one size fits all&quot; skill, so you're at the mercy of the sports ESPN wants to include in the briefing.  Sometimes you'll only get a few seconds dedicated to the team or sport you want to hear about.  If they turned down the gain on the skill and made it quieter, I'd probably go back to using it.

This Skill has one feed for every MLB team so be sure to enable the feeds for the teams you are interested in.  Data for all feeds is currently refreshed every few minutes.

This Skill currently tells you the following during your Flash Briefing:
* Result and score for today's game if already played or in progress
* Time for today's game if not yet played (time reported always in US Eastern timezone)
* Result and score for yesterday's game if there was one

Please note, Flash Briefing Skills must have a ""Default"" feed.  The Tampa Bay Rays feed will be enabled by default (the author's favorite team), so please remember to disable it in your Flash Briefing settings if you do not want Rays information.  Here's how you can enable a different feed:
  1. Open the Alexa App or go to https://alexa.amazon.com
  2. In the Menu, go to Settings
  3. In Settings, go to Flash Briefing under the Accounts section
  4. This will show you all the Flash Briefing ""Feeds"" you have turned On and Off.  You should see ""Tampa Bay Rays Games"" listed under the On section, as that is the default (Go Rays!).  Now under the Off section you should see ""Unofficial MLB Game Info"" with a little down arrow.  Tap that (it may take a few seconds to list them all, this appears to be a bug in Alexa App).
  5. You should now see all the other 29 MLB teams listed.  Find your team and click/tap on it and this will enable the ""Feed"".
  6. Now that team should show under the On section and you can turn off the Rays Feed (or keep it on and embrace them as your favorite AL team!).

You can contact me directly at josh@userdel.com, or https://github.com/irlrobot/mlb_game_info, for feedback and bug reports.  Enjoy!

Let Alexa give you the surf report for most California and Hawaii surf spots.  Also for each surf spot, let Alexa also give you the tide report, the water temperature and let you know when is the best day to surf for the upcoming week.

Using the streamlined commands structure, getting the surf report information for several spots is simple and easy.  

Here are examples to try: 
 
""Alexa, Ask Surf Checker for Salt Creek on Tuesday""
""When is the best day to surf Lowers""
""What is the tide report for San Clemente State Beach on Wednesday""
""What is the water temperature at Lihaina Harbor""
""When is the best day to surf Pipeline""

For surf reports, just say the surf spot name for quick results:
For example, just say ""Sunset Beach"" for the Sunset Beach surf report. Or say, ""Sunset Beach on Thursday"" to get the report for the upcoming Thursday.        

Alexa also remembers the last surf report you requested so that additional reports do not have to include the spot name.   For example once you ask for a report like:
""What is the surf report for Pismo Beach Pier""

You can get the tide, water temperature, and best day to surf at Pismo Beach Pier by saying:
""What is the tide report"" or just ""tide report?""
""When is the best day to surf""
""What is the water temperature"" or just ""water temperature""

If you want to find the tide activity later in the week for Pismo Beach just say:
""Tide report for tomorrow"" or ""Tide report on Friday""

Listed below are JUST SOME of the surf spots available.  There were too many to list here.  The complete list is at www.surfncircuits.com.  New locations soon!!   If you want your surf spot added please mention it in comment below or at www.surfncircuits.com
