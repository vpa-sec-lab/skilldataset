Please note that this skill requires account linking with an existing account at MatHem.se.

Please also note that this is a product targeting https://www.mathem.se. To place orders using the skill you will need to have a previously placed order through https://www.mathem.se.

When you ask for a product, for example 'milk', we'll translate milk into Swedish and perform a category search for it. We order the results based on your previous orders, so if your preference is organic lactose free milk, that is what you will get.

To prevent unintentional purchases we recommend you to add a four digit pincode that you will be prompted to say before placing your order. Your cart and orders are synced in real-time to https://www.mathem.se and the mobile apps, so if you require more advanced features, please use a device with a visual interface.

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

I have unsuccessfully attempted to edit my review three times, which left no alternative but to delete it. Luckily I always write my reviews in another program in case of a glitch. Below you will find my original review and the update.

Update - Attempted April 8th, 9th & 10th:
I received a prompt response from customer service apologizing for the delay and reassure me that they were working to resolve the problem as possible. The resolution process was simple and quick (taking less than 24 hours), and the customer service team kept in contact in regular intervals through until the issue was resolved. That alone was enough to make me want to update my review and give them five stars. But they didn't stop there. After everything was resolved on my end, they checked back again to make sure the recipient had received the gift and was able to apply it with no issues on that end. I will definitely keep GiftJoy in my arsenal of gift giving options.

Original Review - April 6, 2019:
Setting up the skill was fairly easy. The ability to review and finalize the order on your phone was especially helpful since Alexa's voice recognition capabilities continue to get worse. The person I sent a gift card to received the email from GiftJoy right away and clicked accept, which then took him to a page that said his card was processing. That was more than 12 hours ago. I don't know if this situation is a fluke or random glitch. Either way, it's not a very auspicious start. As it stands now, there is no joy related to this gift. I sent an email, but have not received a response yet. If/when the issue gets resolved I will update my review to reflect that.","5.0 out of 5 stars","April 11, 2019","","","",""

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

To get started, first download AnyList from the iOS App Store and create an AnyList account. Then enable this skill and you'll be able to link your AnyList account to Alexa.

After linking your AnyList account, the Alexa Shopping & To-do lists will appear as new lists in AnyList.

The fact that it automatically updates all of us is a bonus. Even better is how my Apple Watch goes “bong” and tells me when my list has been modified. I can literally be at the grocery store and have items added without having to stop and take a call. No more trying to decipher texts from the spelling challenged either!

As for whining about privacy, that went away when we entered the digital world. If you want privacy, stop using mobile devices, computers, Amazon Echo, etc. It is the price you pay for technological convenience.

We tailor deals that interests you.. Tell us which deals you like, as we get to know you better, we will target deals that fits your preferences.

You will receive a four-character personal code (such as“DEMO”), which you can use to review the detail of the deals that you liked at www.mydealweb.com.


How to use:

To launch:
     “ Alexa, open my deal. ”

     “ Alexa, Ask My Deal for the deals of Amazon. ”
     “ Alexa, Ask My Deal what are the deals for iPhone. ”
     “ Alexa, Ask My Deal to tell me the deals for women's outerwear. ”

If you find deals you are interested in, like them by numbers and view the detail on your phone:
     “ one, two and four ”
     “ second and third ”
     “ first two ”
     “ last one ”

Or go to the next group:
     “ next ”

Or want to listen again:
     “ repeat ”

Of cause you can always get help by:
     “ help ”

Or exist any time by:
     “ Alexa, stop. ”

On 9/12/2018 we ordered a ""Whirlpool Dishwasher with 1-Hour Wash Cycle - Stainless Steel"" (Item ID: 99372) from BJs online and were informed it would be delivered in early October.

However, it was not delivered until late October while I was away on a business trip, at 7am on a Monday morning, with my wife receiving only 10 minutes warning by phone.

The delivery person took away our old dishwasher, which was still perfectly functional, and installed the new one, which did not work. He said it was a problem with our wall wiring and left without verifying with my wife.

Later that day we hired a handyman to investigate, and he concluded our wall wiring was fine and it was the dishwasher which was broken.

The following week Whirlpool sent over a representative who verified the dishwasher was defective.

It took another few weeks, with many frustrating calls to BJs (whose customer service agents were very cold and impolite) to finally deliver and install another functional dishwasher. By that time my wife had already been inconvenienced for almost two months -- she has a disability and cannot wash dishes by hand, so had to take our children out to eat every day.

The worst part of this is that when we complained to the Better Business Bureau BJs lied that we were fully compensated for our losses. Hence I resort here to record our painful lesson: let everyone be warned BJs Online is a dishonest and broken business! Shop elsewhere!","1.0 out of 5 stars","January 3, 2019","","","",""

But to use this functionality user must create their Twilio account and provide necessary permissions by visiting  https://mygrocerylist.fillearth.com. User can also complete the authorization process from the Privacy policy page (see link below)

Purpose: Often while going for grocery shopping we forget items that we  need to buy. With this skill, users can add items to the list whenever they find it missing. Then they can retrieve the list all at once just before going for shopping.
Features available: User can add an item, delete an item, retrieve all the items, check when an item is added and also clear the whole list. 
How it works: There is an ""Items"" table in DynamoDB. Whenever user adds an item it gets added to the list. Then when he deletes an item it gets deleted from the list. User can also clear the list at once. All these happens through Dialog.","Guidance Suggested.","my grocery list","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://mygrocerylist.fillearth.com/privacy_policy.html","null","","26","by Suman Chatterjee","26","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B078QCGQVN","4.0 out of 5 stars","Shopping","null","Wow","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2DFP1FJ04M6WB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078QCGQVN","When following the link Tom set up the Twillo account it requires a credit card the will initially charge it $10 and then subsequently keep the balance at $20 just to manage and text the grocery list!

Right now, for those who wonder why to use it instead of the native Alexa skill is because you can move items between lists. So when you come home with your groceries, you can move them to your pantry list. That way, you don't have to wonder if you already have enough cans of tomato sauce.

What the skill needs:
1. It needs to pick up the categories the user has previously assigned items to. Of course, if it was never assigned one on the past, like if something is coming from the store deals tab, then it should remain uncategorized.
2. It should pick up price from previously entered items. This is invaluable to be and keeps me on target with my budget.
3. If it cannot do the above, the user could say ""Add Milk Dairy $5.00""

What would be nice:
1. Ability to move things verbally from shopping list to pantry.
2. Search the list. ""Alexa open Out of Milk. Is chicken on my shopping list? Do I have tomato sauce in my pantry list?""

I am giving four stars right now because I am expecting great things from the developers at Out of Milk.

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

Say your out of the house and your kid is home and won’t pick up the phone because they are ignoring you, their not hearing the phone, or their cell phone is dead. If I was able to send a text for Alexa to broadcast over the speaker(which I have control over with the apps volume control and there probably already using it to play their music while your out)they would hear it and call you back.

But to use this functionality user must create their Twilio account and provide necessary permissions by visiting  https://mygrocerylist.fillearth.com. User can also complete the authorization process from the Privacy policy page (see link below)

Purpose: Often while going for grocery shopping we forget items that we  need to buy. With this skill, users can add items to the list whenever they find it missing. Then they can retrieve the list all at once just before going for shopping.
Features available: User can add an item, delete an item, retrieve all the items, check when an item is added and also clear the whole list. 
How it works: There is an ""Items"" table in DynamoDB. Whenever user adds an item it gets added to the list. Then when he deletes an item it gets deleted from the list. User can also clear the list at once. All these happens through Dialog.","Guidance Suggested.","my grocery list","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://mygrocerylist.fillearth.com/privacy_policy.html","null","","26","by Suman Chatterjee","26","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B078QCGQVN","4.0 out of 5 stars","Shopping","null","Works As Designed.","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29FXJEXTXE78F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B078QCGQVN","I don't know what the previous reviewer said, but there is no cost for this skill.

Your tutorials are horrible. They are visible inadequate.
It should be simple: You put an item on you list, you remove the item off your list once to have it, the item should then automatically go onto your history list.
What happens with this app: You put an item on your list, app automatically puts the item on the history list simultaneously so now it’s in two places, you remove the item off your list once you have it (by deleting or ‘putting in your cart’ whatever the heck you mean by that), either way you remove it, the item goes onto your history list, now you have two of everything you originally added to your list.

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

We'd love to hear about your GiftJoy experience: team@giftjoy.us

You can add and remove items from Food Tracker and ask Food Tracker when items expire. This skill is best used as you are putting away your groceries after going to the store.


To start, add an item with an expiration date, you could say:

""Alexa, create expiration date for [item] on [date] using Food Tracker""

The same item cannot be added twice to the list.


You can do the following things with Food Tracker:
- Add expiration dates for items
""Alexa, add expiration date for [item] on [date] using Food Tracker""
- Check if an item is in the list
""Alexa, ask Food Tracker is [item] in my list""
- Get expiration dates for items
""Alexa, ask Food Tracker, when does [item] expire""
- Get how long before items expire
""Alexa, ask Food Tracker, how long before [item] expires""
- Check if an item has expired
""Alexa, ask Food Tracker has [item] expired"" 
- Get number of expired items
""Alexa, ask Food Tracker how many items have expired""
- Get list of expired items
""Alexa, get all expired items from Food Tracker""
- Get the next expiring item
""Alexa, ask Food Tracker what item is expiring next""
- Get a list of all items
""Alexa, get all items from Food Tracker""
- Get number of all items
""Alexa, ask Food Tracker how many items are in my list""
- Delete an item
""Alexa, remove [item] from Food Tracker""
- Delete all expired items
""Alexa, delete all expired items from Food Tracker""
- Delete all items (BE CAREFUL!)
""Alexa, delete all items in my list from Food Tracker""

Slight variations of the above commands will also work.

NOTE: Disabling and enabling the Food Tracker skill will delete all items in your list.

Additional functionality will be added over time.

It is all you would want out of a shopping list app and more.

Plan your grocery shopping hands-free by dictating entire lists to Alexa. Listonic instantly syncs with Alexa giving you instant access to all your lists which you can then manage accordingly. What’s more, your lists can be shared with friends and family to make sure that everyone stays on top of what is needed. 

Listonic top-rated app helps millions of people around the world save time and money by smart planning and managing their groceries. 

This is how it works on Alexa:

First, you have to registrate a Listonic account on app.listonic.com or in our mobile app. 

Then you can:
- Add a new list with “Create list Joe’s Birthday Party”
- Add items to your list: ""Add apple""
- Check and uncheck items with ""Check/uncheck apple on Joe’s Birthday Party""
- Let Alexa read the articles on your list with “ Read list Joe’s Birthday Party”

To do multiple things consecutively start with:
- ""Alexa, open Listonic.""
After the welcome message continue with:
- ""Change the default list to Joe’s Birthday Party.""
- ""What is on my list?""
- ""Add 2 kilograms of apples to my list.""","Guidance Suggested.","listonic","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://www.listonic.com/content/en/legal/","null","","21","by Listonic sp. z o.o.","21","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075T2DB1R","4.1 out of 5 stars","Shopping","null","Not impressed","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1J0RNRGTL6L6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075T2DB1R","It will only add items to ""Alexa List"".

I deleted something the other day, but when I just tried to add something else using the wording suggested, it told me my other item was lonely and asked me if I wanted to add something. Recap: 1) it kept my deleted item, 2) didn't add my new one, and 3) didn't sync any of them to my app list. I have high hopes for this skill, because I love the app and expect there to be kinks this early on.

But to use this functionality user must create their Twilio account and provide necessary permissions by visiting  https://mygrocerylist.fillearth.com. User can also complete the authorization process from the Privacy policy page (see link below)

Purpose: Often while going for grocery shopping we forget items that we  need to buy. With this skill, users can add items to the list whenever they find it missing. Then they can retrieve the list all at once just before going for shopping.
Features available: User can add an item, delete an item, retrieve all the items, check when an item is added and also clear the whole list. 
How it works: There is an ""Items"" table in DynamoDB. Whenever user adds an item it gets added to the list. Then when he deletes an item it gets deleted from the list. User can also clear the list at once. All these happens through Dialog.","Guidance Suggested.","my grocery list","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://mygrocerylist.fillearth.com/privacy_policy.html","null","","26","by Suman Chatterjee","26","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B078QCGQVN","4.0 out of 5 stars","Shopping","null","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284862011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284862011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=3&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564897792&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_2"

What makes Zen Buggy different is that, as you are shopping, you can mark the aisle locations of the items on your list and then check them off as you add them to your cart. Then, the next time you add those items to your list, they will automatically show up on the correct aisle. Aso, items tagged by other shoppers at the same store will show up as well, but you can easily change the location(s) if items have moved, etc...

Zen Buggy also supports multiple stores, and you can easily move items between them. Items moved will always show up on the correct aisle, as long as they have previously been tagged by you or another shopper.

Pro tip: Use the word ""And"" between items to add multiple items to your list. Zen Buggy looks for that word and uses it to separate your sentence into distinct items. For instance, saying ""Add Peanut Butter and Grape Jelly"" would show up as two separate line items. Try it!","Guidance Suggested.","zen buggy","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","https://www.zenbuggy.com/privacy.htm","null","","1","by GreyMotion Studios","1","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B07MW2SJB7","5.0 out of 5 stars","Shopping","null","","","","","","null","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284862011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284862011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=5&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564897796&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_4"

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

What’s more, your lists can be shared with friends and family to make sure that everyone stays on top of what is needed. 

Listonic top-rated app helps millions of people around the world save time and money by smart planning and managing their groceries. 

This is how it works on Alexa:

First, you have to registrate a Listonic account on app.listonic.com or in our mobile app. 

Then you can:
- Add a new list with “Create list Joe’s Birthday Party”
- Add items to your list: ""Add apple""
- Check and uncheck items with ""Check/uncheck apple on Joe’s Birthday Party""
- Let Alexa read the articles on your list with “ Read list Joe’s Birthday Party”

To do multiple things consecutively start with:
- ""Alexa, open Listonic.""
After the welcome message continue with:
- ""Change the default list to Joe’s Birthday Party.""
- ""What is on my list?""
- ""Add 2 kilograms of apples to my list.""","Guidance Suggested.","listonic","dynamic content.","Developer Privacy Policy","http://www.listonic.com/content/en/legal/","null","","21","by Listonic sp. z o.o.","21","https://www.amazon.com/product-reviews/B075T2DB1R","4.1 out of 5 stars","Shopping","null","works great for me","https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF1ER44XXGIBW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B075T2DB1R","would be nice to have a list of commands","5.0 out of 5 stars","March 9, 2019","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284862011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284862011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=3&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564897792&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_2"

Just make as many lists in iPhone Reminders, then turn settings in Anylist to “Export from Reminder” and make sure “Amazon Alexa” turned on.  Of course, make sure you’re AnyList is on Alexa skill.  Viola.  You can ask Alexa to add any items to any list, like “Add Milk and Cereal to Grocery List” and “Add Detergent to Costco List.”  (And yes, Alexa allows you to now add multiple items at once).

And if you have Google Home, just use IFTT and make a new applet with recipe phrase “Add $ to XXXX List” for each list you want, like Target, grocery, Costco, pet store, etc.  Also make sure to link Google Assistant in IFTTT App.

I prefer Alexa better since it’s smart enough to know if you already have an item on your list, and it can remove items.  Google home is a bit more limited at the moment.","5.0 out of 5 stars","July 6, 2019","Next page→","https://www.amazon.com/Purple-Cover-Inc-AnyList/product-reviews/B074PDF3ZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284862011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284862011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=2&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564897790&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_1"

PLEASE FIX, AMAZON ALEXA HUMANS. Oy... Also Alexa has such WIndows® variety ""nerds 1.0 on parade"" humor. Not Apple Siri by a long shot, as cultural and colloquial awareness goes. We often ask Alexa if she's gotten a sense of humor yet and the response is always ""HMM I don't know that one"". Tell me about it. [Insert exasperated sigh, eyes rolled up into crown of head] Try asking Alexa and Siri ""What's one divided by zero"". Not useful in any practical way...but daily humor is of an immensely underrated value in the coldness of modern digital life.

I love the Bring! app on my phone. Use it regularly for shopping with the family so everyone can add things. So having Alexa integration was awesome, if it would work!

Had no problem syncing it to my main grocery list (no idea how to pick a different list to add things too appropriate list.  Here's an idea, have a command to List my lists, so I know what Alexa calls them).
Hassle to open.  Have to say ""Alexa, open Bring!"", she says ""welcome to bring, how can I help"" ,then after each item is added she has to talk more.  Keep the skill open forever.  I installed if for a reason. I should just be able to say ""Alexa, add milk to my list"" without activating a skill EVERY time.

But I could live with this, but the kicker, Bring! constantly gets it wrong.  Alexa understands my voice fairly well, but for some reason, Bring! gets the item wrong 6 out of 10 times.  I say something clearly, and she adds some obscure item.  If it is wrong, I have no way of removing and re-speaking it.  I ALWAYS end up opening the phone app to correct the misunderstandings, or to verify she understood.

I really want this skill to work.  It is a great skill in theory, and I keep trying hoping it will improve, but after weeks and weeks of using it, I decided it was time to write a review.

Bring! Labs.... PLEASE fix this!
Make her talk less,
Allow me to delete last entry.  If I say ""delete"" right after she repeats the entry, would be nice, because she is wrong SO often.
Give option to read the list (even things added previously from the phone app)
Provide some instructions.  I'm just guessing on this Alexa skill.  Need a ""help"" command.

2 stars is being generous, only because I like the idea of this and hope it will get fixed.","2.0 out of 5 stars","May 12, 2017","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284862011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284862011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=2&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564897790&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_1"

Items cannot be added to specific lists but only the generic Alexa shopping list.  Drilling down into (adding items to) specific lists would be welcome (#newskill).  This is especially true since these unique lists can be shared with Alexa who can tell you what's on them but not interact with (add/delete items) them.

modding this review.  As a test, I tried to get Alexa to add items to my BJs list on Anylist.  But Alexa did not recognize Bj's.  I tried Giant and Walmart lists and it did put items directly into those custom lists - lists that I had already created in Anylist and then selected to sync with Alexa.  So yes - it works, but for some reason it does not recognize all my Anylist list names.  So I'm gonna try to train Alexa.

I see many have shared what I wrote as first review.  If it was a flaw, it's been fixed.  First check your settings and make sure ""Sync with Amazon Alexa"" is on.  You should at that point be able to say ""Alexa, put [item] in my [list name] shopping list.""

As orders are placed, shipped and delivered, Shop Clerk keeps up with the latest status of your order and allows you to keep up to date.

HOW TO USE:

To Enable the Skill: Say ""Alexa, enable Shop Clerk skill"" or search for “Shop Clerk skill"" in the Alexa mobile app or at Amazon.com. Click the enable button on the Shop Clerk skill page.

To use the skill, you must first have placed an order at an ecommerce site that supports ShopClerk order checking. Once you’ve placed an order with a site that uses Shop Clerk, you’ll receive an email with a ‘Shop Clerk Pass Code’. This code is a unique phrase that allows you to get the latest status of your order. Pass codes are easy to remember phrases of 4 words — for example, ‘Alpha Tango Romeo Bravo’.

To check the status of an order, say: “Alexa, ask Shop Clerk about pass code Alpha Tango Romeo Bravo”. Shop Clerk will then tell you the latest status of your order.

The order status in Shop Clerk is updated whenever the on-line store you made the purchase from updates the order in their system. So you’ll always have the latest information whenever you check.

I love to simply be able to tell Alexa to add something to my list. Yes, it might be cool if you could add multiple items rather than one at a time, however, to me the main purpose of this is to be able to add items as you think of them/need them. I open the fridge and see I’m low on milk, “Alexa, add milk to my shopping list.”  Done!  Without grabbing my phone, it’s there. Then 10 minutes later I notice another item to add. Easy and simple. Sure it could be cool in certain scenarios where I do have a long list to add, in which case it could get tiring saying each item one at a time, but for the most part the ability to add things to your list with your voice is to avoid needing to sit down and think... “what are all the items I’m currently out of and need to pick up at the store....”. I don’t need to do this, because I slowly added them as they came to mind. And that to me is what makes this so awesome and functional for my life!  Even before I used Alexa, generally I was only adding one or two items at a time to my list, and this is what would be annoying. I’d grab my phone, add an item, minutes or so later I’d remember something else I need, back to my phone to write it down.

As orders are placed, shipped and delivered, Shop Clerk keeps up with the latest status of your order and allows you to keep up to date.

HOW TO USE:

To Enable the Skill: Say ""Alexa, enable Shop Clerk skill"" or search for “Shop Clerk skill"" in the Alexa mobile app or at Amazon.com. Click the enable button on the Shop Clerk skill page.

To use the skill, you must first have placed an order at an ecommerce site that supports ShopClerk order checking. Once you’ve placed an order with a site that uses Shop Clerk, you’ll receive an email with a ‘Shop Clerk Pass Code’. This code is a unique phrase that allows you to get the latest status of your order. Pass codes are easy to remember phrases of 4 words — for example, ‘Alpha Tango Romeo Bravo’.

To check the status of an order, say: “Alexa, ask Shop Clerk about pass code Alpha Tango Romeo Bravo”. Shop Clerk will then tell you the latest status of your order.

The order status in Shop Clerk is updated whenever the on-line store you made the purchase from updates the order in their system. So you’ll always have the latest information whenever you check.

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

There are several obvious problems.
1. It speaks so fast that he cannot understand it.  I need to be able to slow down teh speech to help him understand.  In fact we can't train it to his voice because it only provides vocal sentences to repeat which of course he cannot because he cannot understand the sentences.  I cannot find a written list of the sentences on the web.
2. Alexa uses a female voce.  Elderly people often have great difficulty understanding female voices due to their high frequency content.  If a low frequency content male voice were available it would help considerably.  (i.e. he can understand men but not most women's speech.)  This is common. How did you guys miss this?
3. Alexa needs to be able to listen and recognize slower speech.  Elderly people often speak slower and insert brief silent pauses in their speech whiel they struggle to get their message across.  Alexa is extremely unforgivign in thsi regard...almos insulting.

The phrases Alexa says while using this skill are unprofessional, and don't match the tone of either Alexa or the Out of Milk app. I am guessing a programmer threw this together and decided to make a joke of it, and no one in management has used it.

In addition to the incongruent tone, it doesn't have a confirmation before deleting all the items on a list. After adding an item to my list, I told Alexa, ""That's all"", and it misinterpreted it as ""delete all"" or ""clear all"" and promptly deleted everything on my list. I then said ""undo"", which it interpreted as ""done"" and exited the skill. If Alexa hears ""delete all"", she should respond with ""You asked me to delete all the items on your [list name] list. Is that correct?"", then only delete them if the user responds with ""Yes"".

I'll gladly upgrade my review to 5 stars if a confirmation is added before removing everything from the list, and if the phrases are changed to match Alexa's overall speech style and tone.","3.0 out of 5 stars","December 5, 2017","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284862011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284862011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=4&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564897794&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_3"

You can choose from over 100 top retailers such as Starbucks, Fandango, Sephora, Barnes & Noble, Applebee's, Domino's, Uber, Nordstrom, Target, Old Navy, Kohl's, and Nike.  

Simply tell Alexa your order by saying: 

""Alexa, open GiftJoy!"" or ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy to send a gift card.""

Through voice, you'll be prompted for your order details such as your name, the recipient's name, the gift card brand and value, when you want the eGift card to be delivered, and your personalized greeting.  

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

The flaw is that it tends to recognize some phrases as a request to erase the entire shopping list.  Alexa then dutifully wipes your list without warning.

You'll then get a text message with a link to review your order and enter your payment details.  So don't worry if you make a mistake, you'll be able to easily make edits in the next step. 

The recipient will get a text message (or email, if you prefer) with a link to the eGift card, which can be redeemed online or in-store.  PLUS: if they prefer a different brand, they can make a swap without any fees.  That means you'll always be sending the perfect gift!

After you've placed an order, you can ask for your order history.  ""Alexa, ask GiftJoy for my order history.""  You'll also get notified  (via email) when the recipient opens their gift. 

Happy Gifting!!

What makes Zen Buggy different is that, as you are shopping, you can mark the aisle locations of the items on your list and then check them off as you add them to your cart. Then, the next time you add those items to your list, they will automatically show up on the correct aisle. Aso, items tagged by other shoppers at the same store will show up as well, but you can easily change the location(s) if items have moved, etc...

Zen Buggy also supports multiple stores, and you can easily move items between them. Items moved will always show up on the correct aisle, as long as they have previously been tagged by you or another shopper.

Pro tip: Use the word ""And"" between items to add multiple items to your list. Zen Buggy looks for that word and uses it to separate your sentence into distinct items. For instance, saying ""Add Peanut Butter and Grape Jelly"" would show up as two separate line items.

The charge will be placed on the credit card DiscountContacts.com has on file. The prescription will be verified by our Customer Service Team and any required Rx updates will be communicated to you by phone or email.
 
Your first order must be placed via the DiscountContacts.com website, mobile site, or with our Customer Service Team at 1-800-822-9864. After your initial order you can reorder via Alexa using your DiscountContacts.com account.

I had a hard time getting this skill to work until I realized I could say:

  ""Alexa, connect me to Out of Milk""

Then if I didn't delay too long between commands I could issue commands (without the words Alexa or Out of Milk"") like the following:

  ""Add bananas to the list""
  ""Add two gallons of milk to the list""  (note: this adds Milk and quantity 2 without units gallons"")
  ""Delete all items on the list""
  ""What items are on the list""

What is still missing from this skill is that when you add items to the list they don't get their proper categories assigned - they all enter as uncategorized.  I think the best solution (if feasible) is that the proper category be automatically assigned and if the items does not have a known category, then something like the following should occur:

  USER: ""Add bat wings to the list""
  ALEXA: ""I don't know a category for bat wings. What category would you like to associate with bat wings?""
  USER: ""Magical potion ingredients""
  ALEXA: ""OK. Bat wings associated with magical potion ingredients and added to the list""

What is also missing is handling units correctly when adding items.  For example, all of the following commands result in adding ""carrots"" with a quantity of ""3"" to the shopping list:

  ""Add 3 carrots to the list""
  ""Add 3 pounds of carrots to the list""
  ""Add 3 cups of carrots to the list""

Handling units is by far one of the best features of Out of Milk so I think proper implementation of units in the Alexa Skill as well as proper handling of categories and new categories would make Out of Milk use with Alexa outstanding.","2.0 out of 5 stars","February 16, 2019","","","Next→","https://www.amazon.com/s?i=alexa-skills&bbn=14284862011&rh=n%3A13727921011%2Cn%3A13727922011%2Cn%3A14284862011%2Cp_72%3A2661621011&lo=list&dc&page=4&fst=as%3Aoff&qid=1564897794&rnid=2661617011&ref=sr_pg_3"
